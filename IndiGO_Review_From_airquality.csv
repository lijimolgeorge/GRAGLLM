0,10th February 2025,Praveenkumar Prem,"""experience was excellent""",✅ Trip Verified ,"   I consistently prefer airlines that allow me to complete immigration and customs procedures in Chennai, India, ensuring my luggage is checked through to my final destination. Consequently, I avoid Air India, which necessitates customs clearance in Delhi or Mumbai. Since 2004, my only options have been foreign airlines. Recently, I booked an international ticket with Indigo for my journey from India to Australia for the first time. Indigo offered a route from Chennai to Singapore on flight 6E 1025, followed by a connection to Sydney with its partner Qantas on flight 6E 4674 (operated by Finnair). I was thoroughly impressed with both Indigo and Qantas. Indigo, as the marketing partner, facilitated a seamless check-in process at Chennai airport, where my luggage was checked through to Sydney, and I received both boarding passes at that time. The Indigo flight 6E 1025 was a new A320, just 0.3 years old, with attentive crew members and a thoughtful food pack. Both departure and arrival were punctual. The Qantas flight, operated by Finnair, also departed on time, providing good service. Overall, the experience was excellent and offered great value for money, earning my commendation for Indigo.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chennai to Singapore,February 2025,5,5,5,NA,5,NA,5,yes

3,4th February 2025,AKR Murugiah,“very disappointed on the service”,Not Verified ," SIN - TRZ. I purchased a Super 6E ticket with Rava Upma with beverage. As the flight started at 2.45am, I was asleep for the first 2 hours. The next 2 hour I was awake and realised that they had completed giving out the meal. No cabin crew approach me for my meal. When the captain started to descend about 30 minutes before landing, one cabin crew approach me to provide my meal and gave me the option to take away. I ordered the meal to be consumed in the flight and not at the airport. I was wide awake for the last 2 hours and no one bothered to give me my meal. I refused the meal and am very disappointed on the cabin crew service. Even a restaurant staff is any time better than Indigo cabin crew. They are more concern with all other duty except for serving the passengers. TRZ - SIN. For the return flight Super 6E service, I had purchased additional Bag, and Prepaid Excess Baggage 15kg So I have 50kg with additional bag. I checked in at TRZ the 50kg and had a hand carry luggage of 4Kg and my laptop bag. I pleaded with the Indigo staff (Hemalatha) to see if I could also check in my hand luggage as I have an hairline fracture on my left wrist. Ms. Hemalatha said that I can only check in if I have my allowance in the 50kg. Considering that I bought additional kg and have my left wrist hairline fracture, I believe Indigo can make an exception to check in the 4 kg hand carry. Disappointed on the way your staff handled it. The announcement and recorded messages in flight are all in Hindi and English. The flight is travelling from Tamil Nadu to Singapore, where Tamil is an official language. 99% of the passengers are all Tamil and mostly worker who are low educated and do not understand Hindi or English.

They are by far the worst airline to use in India. I thought Air India was bad as they randomly cancel flights, but Indigo get the all-time prize for being the worst. If you have a non Indian passport you cannot check in nor can you pay for excess baggage. Then when you get to the airport they have a special rate that is even higher even though you have no way to get the web/pre paid rate. You will spend more for a few kilos than you paid for the flight. We had a stopover as they dont from direct from the Maldives to Agra, so we got to pay the fees twice for both legs of the journey.

The Super 6E offering is a marketing gimmick, and since it includes a fast track option, most people don't mind paying extra for this. Passengers who have booked wheelchairs, families with kids and elderly people ate not respected. The staff handling the boarding in Mumbai disrespected passengers needing assistance, while boarding in Nairobi was handled extremely well, with staff handling boarding understanding the importance of fast track and passengers needing assistance given priority.

9,5th January 2025,Deepika Dhall,"""service was incredibly bad""",Not Verified ,"  The service was incredibly bad. They checked in different location flights together and it created a huge lineup at the counters. It was unorganized and chaotic. We requested the staff to let us move ahead as per our flight schedule but they did not assist in any way. They closed the check in more than an hour ahead of the boarding time. Although on the tickets it is mentioned that check in closes 45 minutes prior to the flight boarding. When we reached the counter, the staff was having trouble with their system and the lady at the counter asked the next counter lady if she could access her system and told us the check in was closed. We were not allowed to board and moved around to different counters. We were there firstly stuck in their long line up, no one made an effort to call the passengers out of that crowded line up as per flight schedule. The staff was inefficient in doing their jobs at the counters and were rude, non accommodating nor helpful. A lot of passengers from our flight were treated the same and denied check in. We were asked to pay extra and take next flight. It was ridiculous as it seemed they had overbooked the flight and now was denying people check in. One of the staff asked us to leave our luggage somewhere there and board the plane empty handed. This is so silly on their part. We had no other option but to pay extra and take another flight but didn't get the direct flight. It wasted our whole day. Later when we were checking in for the later flight after paying extra money, they made us again move from counter to counter as there system wasn't working on one counter and the boarding passes could not be printed on another due to some problem with their printing machine. The staff was having issues processing the tickets so was asking help from another staff sitting on next counter. The service was so slow.

12,25th December 2024,Akshay Singh,"""Terrible Experience""",✅ Trip Verified ,"   Terrible Experience with Indigo Airlines – Long Delays, Poor Communication, Lost Luggage and No Accountability I had a dreadful experience flying with Indigo Airlines on December 14. My journey was supposed to be a 6:40 AM flight from New Delhi to Istanbul, connecting to Chicago at 3:40 PM (Istanbul time). Instead, it turned into a 48-hour nightmare riddled with delays, poor service, and complete lack of accountability. The flight from New Delhi was delayed by over six hours due to operational issues. During this time, we were issued handwritten boarding passes. I was assured that Turkish Airlines, the carrier for my connecting flight, would resolve any issues in Istanbul. This assurance turned out to be misleading. The flight finally departed at 11:30 AM (IST), with an unscheduled refueling stop in the UAE, which extended the flight time to Istanbul to 10 hours instead of the expected 6–7 hours. Upon arrival in Istanbul at 8:30 PM local time, there was no Indigo representative present to assist with the missed connection, and Turkish Airlines staff claimed they couldn’t help without action from Indigo. I was left stranded for over an hour before someone at an Indigo booth asked me to surrender my handwritten boarding pass for rebooking. What followed was a miserable 14-hour overnight stay at Istanbul Airport without any accommodation or proper support. This lack of care was deeply frustrating, especially for an issue caused by Indigo’s delay. I was eventually rebooked on a flight to Chicago departing at 7:35 AM local time the following morning. By this time, I was exhausted, stressed, and sleepless. The problems didn’t end there. Upon reaching Chicago, only one of my two checked bags was delivered. Turkish Airlines staff couldn’t trace the missing bag because Indigo had taken my original baggage tag during rebooking. I had to file a claim online and finally received my missing bag four days later. The inconvenience caused by this mismanagement was appalling. Adding to the frustration, I had pre-ordered meals (Chicken Biryani and Paneer Tikka Sandwich), which were not provided on the flight. While this might seem like a minor issue compared to everything else, it reflects Indigo’s overall disregard for its customers. For an airline that prides itself on efficiency, this was a major disappointment.  Indigo’s inability to manage their delays and collaborate effectively with Turkish Airlines highlights their poor  standards.

They don’t care about customer loyalty. This is even more evident with airlines as there is very little competition in the domestic sector that is now basically a duopoly between Indigo and Air India. I have had heaps of bad experiences with Air India and had to forego many flights when they change schedule. When they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money. I preferred Indigo as I found the service good and had no problems until recently. I had booked return flights IXC-JDH in early July to fly in late August. A week ago on checking my bookings on their app I found they had changed my inbound flight from JDH to IXC from a layover in JAI to DEL. No issue with that. However there was no message or email from the airline of the change. I just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app. Not only that, the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours. Had I not checked I would have missed my flight. As the new time was not suitable to me I called the airline. I was able to change to a later time. However I was told I must pay a change fee of INR 2000 per ticket. You change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it? I explained to the agent that this is an Involuntary change and I must not have to pay for it. The agent put me on hold to get an authorisation. I was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge. In such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation. They should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end. Now after a week, I find out they have once again made a schedule change. They have now moved my flight from JDH to 1450 from 1025. I will arrive in DEL at 1625. However they have not amended my connecting flight DEL-IXC. That is scheduled at 1505, which will land in IXC before I even arrive in DEL. So I am back on the phone to Indigo. I requested them to put me on their DEL-IXC flt at 1725. Once again they are unable to do that. Was advised they will check and call me back. Got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight. They want me to take a 5 hour layover in Delhi and arrive in IXC at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours. I once again pleaded my case. Was told they will check call me again. Again refused, obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport. No empathy at all. There is no recourse, either take it or leave it.

Following things happened at Airport of Hyderabad.  Check in staff charged excess luggage fee which my son was willing to pay, but he struggled due to online payment. The staff removed him from the queue twice and every time made him come in queue.  They happily allowed him to throw his study books in dustbin. No courtesy was shown or effort made to talk to parents. We were online but airline staff did not task to us or help us. They made him go to empty desk and wait and then a staff came. She told, your flight luggage time is closed. You can throw luggage here and board alone. The delay was done by staff by making him queue twice and then denied boarding. He wasnt guided properly to rebook the flight. My son was struggling with bags and there was no human touch to support him. He managed to rebook the flight just to know that all previous ticket features like extra luggage and food were stripped down. They finally took him in next flight with extra luggage cost. I dont have issue paying thrice the price to airline, but really disappointed how they treated a student flying first time. Allowed him to throw books. No guidance.

The in-flight services are also overpriced, with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees.

First, the codeshare with Turkish does not work properly (it is impossible to make the web check-in online and to choose seats, we have to wait until we arrive at the airport). The schedule of this flight is very unconfortable, making us impossible to have a hotel breakfast before boarding. We had 1 hour delay and not a single cabin announcement to explain it. The captain was unable to make any announcement except a brief incomprehensible announcement just before landing. The onboard entertainment was not working and we had to make the whole journey with a white screen, without any idea of the time and our position. The stewardesses distributed water generously, but instead of a meal, I received only a tiny portion of vegetable curry. I was so hungry that I had to rush into a turkish restaurant at the Istanbul airport. The stewardesses are nice, but they still wear the ridiculous ""Girl power"" badge.

We were flying to Lucknow to visit Ayodhya. The reason we booked this flight was that it was a direct 2 hour flight and my parents are old and I did not want to get a longer itinerary with multiple flights. The flight was at 6:45AM. We reached airport at 5:30Am. I just stood in the long queue as it was the only counter that was working there. Later I found that it was for bag drop only. When asking about check-in counter they asked to check in at kiosk. When I reached there, it said check-in window is closed and that was actually very tight I ran to the only counter for all time assistance and it was queue there also. They asked me to go to supervisor Vismaya. Inspite of sharing my concern with her that our trip is a very short one and we need to reach there soon, she just did a formal call to manager who said it is not possible to check in now. My parents flight was already checked in and mine which was separate had some issues checking in one day prior when I tried. They said that your parents can board but not myself. I made humble request to consider our situation. She kept on saying we understand but we cannot help it. She booked another flight and charged extra 2500 INR per person even when the new flight was having several vacant seats. The new itinerary was long and had multiple flights. The second flight was delayed by an hour and they changed gates at the end moment and we were all tired standing up where there was no formal seating arrangement. The staff there also kept on reprimanding people to be standing in like be where there was no queue absolutely. He was just standing there and targeting people unnecessarily. There were heated arguments there also with other passengers and the staff. The airline is absolutely horrible. Staff is inconsiderate and inhuman as I found.

So suffered the ordeal again while flying back where had fellow passengers complaining regrading the same. The boarding experience was unpleasant as they were really unorganised during the zone call.

We called IndiGo's customer care 9 times over three days, and each time, the response was the same: unable to reach the Hyderabad crew, and no managers on the call center floor to escalate our issue. The lack of responsiveness and the inability to locate our bags with crucial manual tags felt like a major oversight. What added to our frustration was that 5 of the 7 manual tags were taken back by the IndiGo team when their system came back online, leaving us without any physical proof.

Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first. For ""Indigo"" Airlines, this is not the case will ""dump"" people onto the Bus and transport them from Gate to the Aircraft. In-Flight: Seating is congested, just like Auto-Rickshaw. The cabin crew is courteous and helpful. Landing: 30 Minutes late from their scheduled arrival. As a result, we had to spend another 30 Minutes at the HYD Airport for Immigration Officers' shift rotation. Overall DOH-HYD Experience is just a dump yard ride for me in Indigo Airlines. The journey from HYD to DOH, concerns starts with Check-In until the Landing. Nonetheless, this part of the journey is the most ""Interesting"" part of this review, don't miss it. Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code. Reached the Airport 4 hours before departure, Kids in arms and eight bags to check-in (opted porter service), had to stay in line for 1 hour 25 minutes to approach the check-in counter after repeated requests to follow the check-in code. Finally, at the check-in counter, the indigo staff was inclined to charge me 15k INR extra as my three bags had 1 kg extra and other bags had less than 23 kg allowed. Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight.

The only reason why I took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the Maldives. After booking the ticket, I noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED.

So basically only pre booked meals passengers were given priority while those even though willing to buy in the air were not even asked if they wanted water. The crew just moved past my row and I had to call her back to ask for the cookies.

166,19th September 2022,S Wayamandi,"""careless with sensitive luggage""",✅ Trip Verified ,"  Indigo was utterly careless in handing a sensitive item like infant / baby child restraint system (CRS) and caused damage even after we safely handed it to them at the gate.  The bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination. The bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly. We use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues.  It is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k INR due to Indigo's shoddy handling. We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later. We later found out that leaving the airport without PIR means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold Indigo liable anymore.

However, in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and I felt compelled to warn other travellers. Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport. It's now been 3 days, my bag is still in Delhi and IndiGo have no idea what's going on. They don't even know the right number to call at Delhi Airport to get an update. At the end of the day, fly IndiGo if you want a cheap flight and can count on things going according to plan, but don't expect any support if there are any disruptions as they don't appear to have the customer's best interests at heart.",NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Delhi via Chennai,February 2022,4,3,3,NA,4,NA,4,no

The boarding also started well on time. One thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions. Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future. The rating is given based on the safety violation of not stowing away the cabin bags under the seat during takeoff but apart from that the flight and crew were really good.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indore to Bengaluru,November 2021,4,4,4,NA,5,NA,4,yes

At Bangalore airport, there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues. Also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes, one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access. This is also something I experienced first hand and was very valuable. The boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking, one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage. I selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time. The food was pretty decent along with the tea. Staff service was prompt and polite.

This was not enough for the airline, they wanted a direct flight back. We again made our travel agent rebook, while we didn't cancel our flight to Bahrain, since we didn't trust the totally misinformed Indigo staff, we travelled, spent days in the Maldives and travelled to Bahrain without any hassles! We checked and rechecked with Male airport as well, no such rule was there! Wrong information besides being totally un cooperative towards customers, we are very disappointed with the airline, especially as I have never experienced this. We had asked to meet with the manager, instead of asking him to come to talk to us, we were sent to some counter where he was seated fidgeting with his phone, laid back and totally uncooperative.

The crew was welcoming and wished everyone during boarding and deboarding which was much appreciated as these small things do matter.

Based on their USD cancellation fee of $45 that should be charged for cancellations made 4+ days before departure, I should receive a $135 refund. Or if they were strictly following this fee applied per person per flight, then that would be $45 per person per way, i.e. $45x4=$180 so I should not receive any refund.

Before boarding all passengers were given a Safety Kit packet which included a face shield,face mask and 5-6 pouches of hand Sanitizers, also the best thing was that all the middle seat passengers were also made to wear the safety gown along with the face mask and face shield which is a good safety measure.

The airline claimed that the flight was cancelled due to Covid restrictions but is clear that the flight was cancelled due to lack of good loads and so instead of the usual travel time of 2.5 hours the total flight duration was almost 6 hours which could have been better. At least during the online check-in the airline didn't charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief. Both the flight segments themselves were quite okay and departed well on time even though some of the conduct of the passengers was questionable like not wearing the face shield / hazmat suit for the middle row seats even despite the crew reminding the passengers to wear it numerous times. Nowadays when flying low cost carriers, it seems like a bus journey with wings where the airlines try to get as many passengers stuffed inside the aircraft as much as possible. If you are a passenger who likes to travel in a bit of exclusivity and luxury without feeling claustrophobic about the number of people surrounding you, you are better off travelling on other airlines.

We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on. But the crew instead of sending them back to their seat, make them sit in the first row, which is a paid row.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Istanbul via Doha,May 2019,1,2,NA,NA,3,NA,3,no

We told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change, but he still didn’t want to let us in and asked us to go to the Indigo customer care outside of the airport. When we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one Indigo agent that was there. After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he can’t help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to “deal” with us that was even less helpful. By this time, boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldn’t do anything. We asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that. She said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed. By this time, all early flights were gone, and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to Goa for May 30th were booked. We booked our flight with Fly Air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at Delhi. We called the hotel in Goa to advise them we wouldn’t make it to the hotel that day, but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day, but unfortunately we couldn’t. Because of the service from Indigo airlines and wrong information given to us by them, we had to spend 6 times the price of our original flights, lost 1 day of hotel in Goa and had to book another extra night in Delhi.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Goa,May 2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,no

The staff at the boarding gate (QAS) staff, were rude they do not even try to be polite of courteous and straight away give ultimatums saying throw away the duty free, go back to duty free and return it, however if you do no return in 20 minutes we will offload you from the flight.

They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi.

I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed.

Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time! Then she ran with us to the security area, asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate. We got to the gate as last passengers entering!

They have all sorts of arbitrary rules that don't affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience. For example, a few times I've arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day. Every time they refuse despite having plenty of space - apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing. Today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg. Why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane?

While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board!

The plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time. The seats were a bit tight and legroom wasn't that good so I was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight. The head-rest of the seat also wasn't that comfortable. But you know, you can't expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrow-body type. With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle.

384,21st May 2017,V Andrews,"""comfort might be a difficulty""",✅ Verified Review ,"  Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again?

Thanks to porters for being a great help and carrying my hand baggage. I'd like to mention staff who came with chocolates and biscuits and offered it to all kids as it was children's day!

Enquired from IndiGo staff attending at and they informed me that since the tube was marked 'fragile' it would arrive separately very shortly (which it did) and asked me if I was connecting to an IndiGo flight and on my answering, yes, I was, IndiGo said they will assign staff member to escort me and my luggage to domestic departures. A lady took charge of me and my luggage - she insisted on pushing my trolley, I insisted on doing it myself; I won - and took me all the way to IndiGo x-ray security. As I was carrying a bottle of duty-fee liquor in my carry on, and since liquor cannot be carried on domestic flights, I checked my back pack through x-ray and the IndiGo staff, to avoid bottle smashing, tied my backpack up very securely and put a fragile tag on it and asked the staff escorting me to inform IndiGo check in counter, where the pack was specially tagged and given to a baggage handler to carry it personally into the baggage room.

During Delhi transit, we were asked to stay in our seats while the crew changed and cabin was cleaned for on-going flight to Kolkata.

I believe Indigo keeps these seats reserved as you can pay on board to upgrade these seats but no one bothered me for moving to these seats.

I checked other airlines before I booked and IndiGo were consistently cheaper, often by a wide margin. Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out.

442,7th June 2015,Pinaki Bhadury,IndiGo customer review,NA,"6E189 6th June. Low budget Airline - their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. On time is a good thing - their flights are often now delayed or run late. Check-in process - everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. Two days back on 4th June I did Web Check in for my 6th June flight using my smartphone. While I was successful in doing web check-in in spite of me giving the email address and phone no I did not get a copy of the boarding pass - beating the while process of doing Web check-in. At Delhi T1 terminal when I tried to print my boarding pass at the Check in Kiosk while it displayed the Boarding Pass I did not get my print out! On taking it up with the ground staff I got a casual reply - please stand in the queue even though I mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. As a result I reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented ""Sir you are very late please be on time next time""! I have booked 3 tickets for my family through on-line booking system. After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking.

443,29th May 2015,Roma Solomon,IndiGo customer review,NA,We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,4,3,N/A,NA,NA,2,no
444,27th April 2015,P Gould,IndiGo customer review,NA,Went from Delhi to Kochi because there is no such thing as a direct Delhi to Male (Maldives) flight and even with connections you have to mix and match airlines in order to get a halfway decent connection schedule.

445,16th April 2015,Tan Ying Kuan,IndiGo customer review,NA,DEL-PNQ(Pune)-DEL. December 2014. Worst possible time of the year to fly out of Delhi. Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,2,3,2,NA,NA,4,yes

449,24th February 2015,Manoj Chaumal,IndiGo customer review,NA,Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,1,3,N/A,NA,NA,2,no

Whilst we could not check in online with young children for some reason the check in staff ensured we were allotted the seats we requested. Staff were also flexible with us checking in most of our luggage (and exceeding the 15kg/person) instead of taking a carry on bag for each of the children making our lives easier.

Have to always commend the cabin crew on their providing a comfortable flight. Noticed something new this time: on deplaning one of the cockpit staff emerges to join the cabin crew in bidding adieu. I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,5,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,5,yes

Then I had a SLR Camera with lenses plus a change of clothes and some files. They asked me to pack all the fragile items into one bag and check-in the other. Imagine my situation. There was no way I could fit all the fragile items into one bag and weigh in at less than 7 kgs. I checked-in the bag and nothing was damaged. On to other aspects of the flight. The seats are cramped and the seat back is very thin. You feel the knees of the guy behind you! The food they sell is mediocre.

The flight took off from Chennai on time with the captain warning us beforehand that there was very heavy weather over Bangalore that he would try to avoid. We eventually got to Bangalore airspace and ended up circling for 20 minutes or more until the captain announced that the thunderstorm had passed and we could land before our fuel situation worsened. Reasonably comfortable seat and friendly crew possibly the most efficient LCC in the Indian skies at the moment and wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,5,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,5,yes
461,12th October 2014,Sriharsha Narasimhan,IndiGo customer review,NA,Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,no

463,1st September 2014,J Knibbe,IndiGo customer review,NA,Flew from Delhi to Coimbatore and then from Chennai to Kolkata. This is an outstanding low-cost airline. I couldn't really find any fault with them! All staff were very friendly professional and helpful the planes were modern and spotless the captain gave informative and friendly announcements before during and after the flight the food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced; and the inflight magazine was well-produced. In Delhi we got stuck in a traffic jam caused by a sudden storm and so we only arrived at the aiport about 10 minutes before the flight. We assumed that we would miss the flight and have to make a plan B but the excellent and helpful staff quickly issued us boarding passes and rushed us to the plane so we still got away on time.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,5,4,5,NA,NA,5,yes

Ground staff at Bangalore airport were a bit disorganized but managed to get us on board fast. Seat was fairly ok but if you are a large person you will feel very uncomfortable as the armrests on this airline did not go up. After take off we were offered drinks despite Indigo being a budget airline. I felt a little hungry halfway through the flight and I manger to get a packet of chips for a cheap price. After which we landed in Pune fresh and nourished. Overall Indigo I feel has service that is better than any other budget airline that I knew.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,4,3,N/A,NA,NA,5,yes
466,22nd July 2014,M Fewster,IndiGo customer review,NA,Flew Chennai Jaipur and return. Efficient service good value and organization from a cut price carrier. New clean aircraft friendly staff. Only problem was that out first booking had not actually been confirmed despite us having a booking number. I received nothing from Indigo to tell me this and I missed the small print on my booking. With an 30 minutes to spare a very helpful groundstaff person went to a lot of trouble to get us new bookings and got us the last seats on our flight. Brickbats for not providing better info re the not confirmed booking (we still don't know why) but kudos to the staff member who helped us in Chennai airport.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,4,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,4,yes

470,13th March 2014,Devayani Hirani,IndiGo customer review,NA,Kept waiting for more then one hour in the plane to pick up some late comers. I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality. Never again.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,1,1,N/A,NA,NA,3,no
471,5th March 2014,Marek Wrobel,IndiGo customer review,NA,Last week I flew from BOM to Goa and return. Both flights were slightly delayed (ca 15 mins) but the quality of the service has compensated for these minor delays. The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals. In general comparing to European 'no frills' airlines IndiGo presents generally a better offering and service.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,5,5,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,4,yes

473,20th February 2014,P Kale,IndiGo customer review,NA,I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs. Moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,no

I took the morning flight at 8.20 am this meant that I did not have my breakfast before the flight. The flight duration to Delhi is 150 minutes. I wanted to have my breakfast on the flight I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least. They just walked past me and did not ask if wanted anything. They simply pushed the trolley past and went and sat down. I gave up and sat extremely hungry and frustrated.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,2,1,1,NA,NA,2,no

476,13th January 2014,S Srinivasan,IndiGo customer review,NA,"MAA-DEL. It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,5,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,5,yes
477,2nd January 2014,Patel Beena,IndiGo customer review,NA,I flew from Pune to Bangalore on 30th December 2013 on Flt 6E 407. I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo.

I was served food only 15 minutes before the flight was to Land i.e 1.5 hrs after the flight took off. The service started late and then the crew were serving/selling in each row going back to front rows serving water discussing menu options with those buying and chatting amongst themselves. On other airlines food is first served to those who pre-book. After selling to all they don't have many items left for serving. Suggest they keep the standard menu and serve pre booked passengers first.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,1,1,2,NA,NA,3,no

You get what you pay for and you know what you're paying for and Indigo delivered to a T and with aplomb. New clean airy decor aircraft lovely FAs. And a lovely touch that others could copy: no jetway but instead of steps up they have a ramp so it's easy to get rollers up to the plane. Spent half an hour on the ground at Cochi during which the cabin was well-cleaned (lavatories included) and properly vacuumed.

Clean and spotless aircraft's legroom a bit limited though. Cabin crew very efficient and lot of smiles. Masala tea bought on board was tasty. Bus rides between gates and aircraft.

I am quite fussy about my travelling because of which I have completely put my faith in Indigo Airlines. I love the fact that the flights are punctual and the passengers are not made to wait. The flight attendants welcome you with a warm smile and make you feel comfortable. The flights are well maintained and the washrooms are also hygienic. The crew and the management have certainly done a wonderful job in keeping their patrons happy and satisfied. There was plenty of legroom available on-board even though my flight was full. If you are planning to travel with elderly people then do not worry. The staff are extremely friendly. This airline has always been my preference over others.

I highlighted this immediately to the cabin crew whilst boarding was going on. Told it would be cleaned in the next clearance and nothing could be done at that time. I was shocked and surprised with this answer. The cleaning was done in Ahmedabad by ground staff and then the flight took off for my destination Chennai.

501,14th March 2013,Sidath Baranage,IndiGo customer review,NA,I flew with Indigo in August 2012. Given the hype about this airline I thought of giving them a try and they didn't disappoint. Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge.

I was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal. Upon arrival I was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and Indigo were unsure when departures would take place. They immediately asked me if I would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening I declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties. The whole affair was so well handled I was most impressed by Indigo's ground staff. This is one rare gem in the Indian aviation scene.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,N/A,5,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,5,yes
505,8th January 2013,Tasneem Yousuff,IndiGo customer review,NA,For the first time my husband and I travelled with Indigo airlines 2 days ago and were very sceptical as it was a budget airline and we had slightly excess baggage. To our surprise from our very first contact with the Indigo airline staff to the end of our trip we were impressed. The lovely young lady at Mumbai airport greeted us with pleasantries checked in our luggage which was a bit above the limit. Once on board on our flight to Singapore we found the seats spacious and comfortable the crew courteous and professional. The inflight service was excellent and reasonably priced. We purchased some spiced chai and cookies that came beautifully packaged in a tin. Regular announcements by the crew were clear and polite.

507,25th December 2012,Kapil Khandelwal,IndiGo customer review,NA,I travelled from Bangalore to Jaipur. The leg space between seats was the length of my iPad.

Planes are new and modern crew all young pleasant and helpful and speak perfect English. Seating is very tight - the person in from of me reclined their seat and it was in my face. They sell food which is tasty and well priced. One major negative as at check in at HYD. My company bought my ticket in the US and they asked me to produce the credit card. As I could not they denied me boarding until I bought another ticket which was very frustrating and almost caused me to miss the flight.

518,15th July 2012,S Srinivasan,IndiGo customer review,NA,"MAA-HYD. The crews are friendly the airplanes clean they still run a largely on-time operation and prices remain very affordable. The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment. Even worse if you have to make a change to your reservation the ""convenience fee"" is charged every time you make a change. IndiGo is unfortunately picking up the bad habits of the Spirits and Ryanairs of the world though at least the service is very good for now anyway.",NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
519,30th May 2012,Madhu Sudan Sharma,IndiGo customer review,NA,Bangkok-Delhi. Plane was new though no inflight entertainment which most of them have. No food or beverage unless you buy. For a flight of 4.30 hours strange thing. A cup of premixed tea cost 100 THB (INR 170.00).,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no
520,29th April 2012,S Krishnaswamy,IndiGo customer review,NA,Bangalore to Delhi return. Ground staff and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. The planes used also were new clean and comfortable. The food too was pretty good. However it is better that they sell at least a water bottle. Although they do sell water they provide it in paper cups and every time I had to pay Rs 40.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
521,4th April 2012,Savi Mull,IndiGo customer review,NA,BOM-LKO. Flew on Indigo thrice and all 3 flights were delayed. Paid extra to book seat of choice and meal. Check-in staff extremely rude and unfriendly. Cabin was not as clean as they rave about. Inflight cabin service without a smile. Only cold meals served. They also charge for wheelchairs with fares comparable to full service carriers. Not my choice and not recommended. Very pricey for a 'low cost airline'.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no
522,9th March 2012,Monica Modak,IndiGo customer review,NA,SIN-DEL The flight was awful. I asked for an exit row seat and got the seat in front of exit row which did not recline. Had to sit upright for 6 hours. Babies hollering and crying everywhere. No food or drink unless you buy - they should at least serve a sandwich on an international flight - what does it cost? 50 cents?,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no

525,28th February 2012,H Hingorani,IndiGo customer review,NA,BKK-BOM-BKK. Friendly crew. Check-in both in BKK and BOM easy. Food onboard was very expensive compared to Air Asia. I always carry snacks. Water free. Plane 2/3 full. Everything was so hassle-free that I have already booked two more flights on this route for May and October at the same price.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
526,6th February 2012,V Arumugam,IndiGo customer review,NA,Kolkata-Chennai-Pune leg. The airline offers a very good product with excellent staff to go with it. The aircraft is well-maintained and the staff know what they are offering.

527,28th January 2012,R Prasidh,IndiGo customer review,NA,"Airline staff at Ahmedabad were unprofessional and non-committal. Flight to Bangalore from Ahmedabad scheduled at 5 pm was delayed more than 3 hours and the behaviour of ground staff was irresponsible. As the expected time neared and no trace of the aircraft was seen the answer I got from ground staff was ""we don't know"". Arrival at Bangalore airport was chaotic. It took ground staff more than 40 minutes to put the baggage on the carrousel. Passengers arriving on other airlines were exiting the terminal before our baggage was even on the carrousel. Indigo was my preferred airline until my previous trip - a very steep deterioration in quality.",NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no
528,5th January 2012,O Amin,IndiGo customer review,NA,BBI-DEL. Flight slightly delayed due to late departure at Delhi. Seated next to the exit no recline for the seat and the other passenger behind! Aircraft was clean although some parts broken. There were huge selections of snacks and beverages. Although the water comes in such a tiny glass you have to pay for it. Cabin Crew friendly and with a natural smile. Overall this airline is professional.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
529,5th January 2012,V Ladhani,IndiGo customer review,NA,BOM-DEL-BOM. Boarding was swift and passengers greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight left on time and the service friendly with enough information was given by FA's. The flight on second leg was one hour late and IndiGo did manage to reach out passengers by sending SMS. Again friendly crew and clear information from FA's. The only downside is the food could be tastier. The food sold inflight has absolute no value of money and leg space is poor for an 188 cm man. I had to fit in and sit in slanting positing.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
530,28th December 2011,Badal Rag,IndiGo customer review,NA,DEL-BKK on newly introduced international service by Indigo. Clean aircraft everything BOB on time and professional crew.

531,14th December 2011,C Vinod,IndiGo customer review,NA,Did BOM-MAA once and doing my second today. Great crew. Very helpful at check-in. Courteous onboard and new aircraft's. Only hitch is food. While ticket rates are on par with Jet and AI particularly after KF problems one has to buy food and that too from a limited choice. Pre-booking is there but the website does not guide as to how.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
532,18th November 2011,R Larson,IndiGo customer review,NA,Kolkata to Hyderabad. Check-in staff pleasant. Cabin crew professional and courteous. Aircraft clean but seats very tight. For a 2-hour flight the low price was more important than seat comfort.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
533,30th September 2011,A Jain,IndiGo customer review,NA,Mumbai-Bangalore. Flight on time great service from airport check-in to end stage. Well planned and executed model for passenger satisfaction.

534,23rd June 2011,G Girish,IndiGo customer review,NA,BLR-DEL return trip. Had a good experience yet again. The flights took had a timely pushback. Onward journey a bit delayed due to bad weather at BLR and the pilot had to change the takeoff runaway direction. Crew courteous and got my pre booked food. Return journey was uneventful as well. Will surely continue flying Indigo.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
535,17th February 2011,Rishad Patell,IndiGo customer review,NA,Bombay-Jaipur return Pune-Nagpur. Easy check in and nice friendly staff in Bombay. On the return (Jaipur to Bombay) we were asked to carry no hand baggage onboard as it was a high security day. The airline could have informed us earlier as had breakable stuff in my hand baggage and they forced me to check it in. Pune to Nagpur efficient and competent crew.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
536,4th February 2011,V Alapaty,IndiGo customer review,NA,Connection at Madras to Hyderabad (coming from US) and back to Madras connecting to US. Both trips an hour long each.

537,24th January 2011,R Sunil,IndiGo customer review,NA,Return flights from Goa to Delhi the experience was enjoyable with efficient checking in DEL-BOM. An efficient airline which prides itself at being on time with helpful air and ground crews. New clean aircraft - just one grouse though a low cost carrier it would be great if the leg space was better. I am about 6 feet tall and it becomes uncomfortable in case of flights which are over an hour or so.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes

539,8th October 2010,Simon Dadd,IndiGo customer review,NA,MUM-DEL. Excellent service - paid Rs300 for the front row which if you're my size is worth it! Inflight food is on a pay basis nothing special but it's good size portions and not bonkers expensive. Great inflight crew cheerful and engaging brand new planes. My first choice now for domestic Indian flights.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
540,7th September 2010,Mukesh Lal,IndiGo customer review,NA,DEL-CCU-DEL NAG-DEL a few times and happy to take IndiGo. The seat pitch makes me feel a little cramped at times but otherwise is excellent. The crew is courteous and always ready to help.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
541,17th August 2010,R Patell,IndiGo customer review,NA,Pune to Nagpur return. Smooth efficient check in. Flight 80 minutes with breakfast you can buy onboard.

543,4th July 2010,Hirofumi Suda,IndiGo customer review,NA,Kolkata to Guwahati and Kolkata to Bangalore. Check-in okay not too friendly. Aircraft were new so cabins kept clean. Seats okay. Cabin crew better than ground crew. Cheap tickets. The only complaint is that the food is expensive - INR 150 for chicken sandwich is too much considering it's just a 2 piece sandwich which you can get for INR 50 at super-markets. The great thing about IndiGo is the on-time performance.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
544,30th June 2010,N Sarkar,IndiGo customer review,NA,Kolkata-Jaipur route on time clean aircraft and nice crew. One bad thing about this airline is that they do not even serve water at free. Snacks were expensive outside foods are allowed.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
545,29th June 2010,S Dadd,IndiGo customer review,NA,DEL-CCU-DEL. Full flight outbound but seated in front row which was good. No queues at checkin nice crew cheerful and professional. Flight left on time and landed early - baggage was off within a few minutes wait. Coming back slightly less good check in experience - at airport several hours early after arriving in international - wouldn't let us check in until 2 hours before departure. When asked for front row seats were told we'd have to pay - got it free on outbound guess I was lucky! Flight crew again cheerful and attentive. Flight was early again bags took about 20 mins but that's par for the course in Delhi. Inflight food not paid and ok value for money.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
546,8th June 2010,A Chitre,IndiGo customer review,NA,BDQ-HYD via BOM. The check-in at Vadodara was smooth though they did not give me through check in to Hyderabad.

548,19th December 2009,S Anand,IndiGo customer review,NA,DEL-PNQ. Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant.
