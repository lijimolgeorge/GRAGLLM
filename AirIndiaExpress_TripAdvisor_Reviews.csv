Forcibly charging for a seat,Deepjyoti B,Dibrugarh - Bengaluru,"Airport team charged extra for the seats saying i have not booked the seats.
My questions is when i book a flight ticket technically am i not also booking a seat ?then why was i asked to pay extra for the seat.

Let‚Äôs start with the filthy seats‚Äîcovered in mysterious stains that made me question whether cleanliness is even a concern for this airline. It was absolutely disgusting to witness such negligence from a company that is supposed to prioritize hygiene and passenger comfort.

But the horror didn‚Äôt stop there. I had prepaid for a meal, expecting a decent breakfast to prepare myself for the day ahead. Instead, I was left hungry and frustrated, as the cabin crew conveniently decided not to serve it‚Äîciting the short duration of the flight as an excuse.

We flew from Srinagar to Del on 06th January 2025. Our flight was delayed due to poor weather conditions however there is no intimation from Airline side on delay and they kept us waiting without any intimation. The boarding gate was changed at the last minute and still they continued to display the same gate number at airport display TV‚Äôs. What was astonishing is that new gate there was no display and many passengers did not even realise as to for which flight they were boarding. What was even more annoying is that they made all passengers to walk in rain and freezing cold up till aircraft and did not provide either a vehicle or aero bridge facility till air craft. Every one had to walk on slippery and snowy walk way. The seats and in cabin was dirty with left over food by previous flyers. There were old food menus with a different rate card and after ordering food we realized that they have revised rates. While the cabin crew were found to be courteous other staff were found to be cold. Overall it lacked ‚ÄúTata‚Äù signature quality and hospitality

A Nightmarish Journey with Air India Express,Passport42704763536,Guwahati - Kolkata (Calcutta),"What should have been a simple trip from Guwahati to Kolkata turned into a harrowing ordeal for my family and me on 2nd January 2025. We had meticulously planned our journey, traveling from Shillong by road to catch Air India Express Flight IX1592 , scheduled for 10:05 PM. Little did we know the nightmare that awaited us.

The flight was rescheduled multiple times‚Äî10:55 PM, then 11:20 PM‚Äîand eventually canceled outright, without prior intimation. Imagine being stranded at the airport late at night with a 10-year-old child and no alternative arrangements made. No rescheduled flight, no accommodation, no food‚Äîjust a void of communication from the airline staff.

We were left perplexed and helpless. At 1:15 AM, I had to scramble to find a hotel for my family, incurring unexpected expenses. Two days later, I had to book another flight, adding to the financial burden. Beyond the monetary loss, the emotional toll was immense‚Äîwatching my child and wife endure this chaos was heart-wrenching.",Domestic,1.0,January 2025,6 January 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0
Extremely Disappointing Experience with Air India Express,Camper34051763428,Guwahati - New Delhi,"I am writing to share an incredibly frustrating experience during my mother‚Äôs travel on Air India Express Flight IX 1198 from Guwahati to Delhi on 4th January 2025. This was, without a doubt, the most poorly managed journey we have ever encountered.

Endless Delays:
The flight delay updates were relentless‚Äîstarting from an SMS on 3rd January at 11 PM, notifying us of a revised departure time of 11 AM, to multiple escalations throughout the day: 2 PM, 4:20 PM, 5:50 PM, 7:15 PM, and finally 7:55 PM. The flight landed in Delhi at 11:30 PM, with passengers only allowed to deboard at midnight.

Zero Customer Support:
During the prolonged delays, repeated calls to customer service yielded no meaningful help. Options provided were either a refund or rescheduling, neither of which was practical as my sister had already boarded her connecting flight. Requests for basic support such as food, accommodation, or cab assistance were outright denied. Even on the late-night flight, no meals were provided.

Travel Challenges Post-Landing:
My mother and sister were scheduled to travel to Greater Noida after landing, but due to the late-night arrival (12 AM), this was not a safe or feasible option. Considering the time and safety concerns, we sought accommodation at a nearby hotel. However, no assistance was provided by the airline. My mother was redirected multiple times by staff without resolution, and the helpline executives were dismissive, even disconnecting calls midway. Ultimately, I had to book a hotel at my own expense.

Impact on Passengers:
Due to the airline‚Äôs negligence, I incurred an additional expense of ‚Çπ2,047 for the hotel. The ordeal caused my mother severe stress, exhaustion, and health issues, including headaches and vomiting after returning home.

Conclusion:
The lack of accountability and empathy from Air India Express is deeply disappointing. The airline's failure to provide even basic assistance during extended delays or to ensure passenger safety post-landing is unacceptable. I urge them to improve their customer support and contingency planning for such situations.

I strongly caution anyone considering Air India Express for their travels‚Äîbe prepared for delays, stress, and zero support from the airline.",Domestic,1.0,January 2025,5 January 2025,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,1.0

AI Express Chennai - Kochi IX 4504 Experience,Wander40969350098,Chennai (Madras) - Kochi (Cochin),"We have travelled from by IX 4504 Chennai - Kochi 1 AM flight on 2nd January. 

Although heard many poor feedback about the aircraft and other services we have opted for AI Express as the fare was economical and the timing.  However, our experience reinforced the poor feedback about AI Express. 

The flight was as scheduled.  There was no rush for checking in. We were sitting at gate no 20 for boarding.  The boarding started 15 minutes late.  The bus carried us (Zone 3 passengers) upto the aircraft.  The bus was waiting for further instruction to allow us to get down.  All the passengers were waiting impatiently to get down and board the plane. There were small children in the bus.   Hope you can understand the difficulty of passengers who were supposed to be in deep sleep and had to stand for quite a long time.  

We saw some staff coming down fast from the aircraft with the waste after cleaning.   Some ground staff were standing near the aircraft discussing something.    The passengers were at a loss to understand what was happening.  After 20 minutes (around 1.20 am) of wait we were allowed to board the aircraft. The cabin was hot.  The inside of the aircraft reveals the poor overall maintenance of the cabin. 

The boarding was completed by 1.40 am.  Two ground staff found interacting with the captain and the cabin crew.  Then the captain announced that the flight was about to depart,  apologised for the delay and inconvenience.   However, there was no sign of the flight moving to the runway.  Then the captain announced that they are waiting for some documents from DGCA, which was being arranged by the ground staff. 

Around 2 am the flight moved to the runway.  But the take off was not happening.  At last the flight took off around 2.20 am and reached Kochi by 3 am. 

I was thinking after the taking over of TATA things might have improved.  But no considerable change could be noticed either in timely operation of the flight  or the smartness of the cabin crew. 

Now I have to think twice before booking by Air India Express.  Of course, I will share this experience with my contacts.

This is for your information and favourable action to improve the quality of service.

"Mishandled cabin pressure, denial and bad response to customer's suffereing",Dhanesh A,Pune - Chennai (Madras),"I have 2 issues:
1. The flight attendants were playing with lights during the flight many times, which I think is related to cabin pressure too. During the flight, nearing to Chennai, I started having STRING PAIN in my sinus area, around cheeks and back head. It was unbearable pain. Also, my doughter was complaining of discomfort in ear. This is issue 1 - mishandled air pressure.
2. When I was suffereing, my wife called for help to the attendant sitting right in front. To our surprise, she denied coming for assistance saying seat belt sign is ON.
So I believe Air India does not know how to manage air pressure in flights and then staff is not bothered about the suffereings of the customers because of the things.

I explained that everything in my luggage was essential, yet they showed no flexibility or understanding. After reluctantly removing some items, they insisted on rechecking the luggage, adding to my frustration. This was very disheartening, especially since we had traveled after two years for a vacation.

Extremely Disappointed with the staff behavior (Susmita),Scenic68027111013,Mumbai - Ranchi,"**Review for Air India Express**

I recently flew with Air India Express, and I have to say, it was an absolutely horrible experience. My luggage check-in time was 4:50 AM, and due to unexpected traffic caused by construction, I arrived at 5:01 AM. Instead of offering any help, Susmita at the counter simply denied me boarding and acted like I was an inconvenience. 

I usually leave my home two hours early to avoid any issues, but this day was different, and I was not the only passenger affected. Rather than showing any empathy, she spent her time on her phone, completely ignoring us. After begging for about 15-20 minutes, she finally called her supervisor, only to demand an extra 4,000 rupees to board with my luggage, claiming I was late. Meanwhile, another passenger with no luggage was also charged 4,000 because he hadn‚Äôt done web check-in. It was absurd.

On the return leg, I faced another issue with a connecting flight. My flight was late, and all I got was a 5 rupee water bottle for my trouble. I arrived in Bangalore at 12:45 PM, with a connecting flight at 1 PM. Somehow, the flight was fine waiting for some passengers but couldn‚Äôt show the same courtesy to me when I was late.

It‚Äôs not just about the money; it‚Äôs about the complete lack of professionalism and respect from the staff. If you want to charge extra for being late, just ask. But ignoring passengers while you‚Äôre glued to your phone? That‚Äôs just unacceptable. 

Air India Express, you claim to be part of the Tata group, a name synonymous with hospitality. This experience was the complete opposite. I am extremely disappointed and will never fly with you again.",Domestic,4.0,October 2024,9 October 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0

Bad experience with cancellation and poor customer service,Bullet_cam,Pune - Kochi (Cochin),"This is not the first time I was picking up on Air India Express. I have a much larger consumer court case with  the same company due to a bad experience 3 months back. When you see things going from bad to worse, its time to vent it off somewhere.

I had a trip planned from Kochi to Pune and back with family. The onward journey was with Indigo an it went very well with on time departure and arrival.

I had booked the tickets almost 6 weeks before the journey as I had my mother and my kids travelling with us. Five days before our journey gets a message that the flight is cancelled and they were putting us on another flight. The only problem was the layover at Bengaluru was almost 11 hours and that too from 9 pm to 8 am. I tried my best at Pune airport to get them convinced that I cannot stay put at Bengaluru airport for that long with elderly and young kids. The staff at Pune airport understood the situation and they tried all possible ways to help us. But everything got stone walled by the management citing company policy.

In fact, there was another Indigo flight that I could have taken at the last minute, but the prices were too steep for me to consider and there were only 2 seats available. So we found our own accommodation at Bengaluru (additional expenses) and the entire day was wasted. 

Just like the airline policy, we paying  customers should also have our rights regarding cancellations and compensation.

There is a larger customer issue with Air India Express mobile app and a mess up which i am fighting with them in consumer courts. This new experience just reinforced their terrible customer service. Their web chat Tia is the worst. There is no human touch to the whole process.

NEVER AGAIN!,Excursion50181645326,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"The most disgusting excuse of an airline. The boarding experience started with a 1 hour delay without any intimation throughout the whole delay or apology at any point. Upon boarding we were greeted with a putrid smell of urine instead of crew. Lunch service began with a stewardess dropping meal packs on me thrice while their trolley was parked by my seat at the isle. By the third time the curry spilled all over my pants, the seat and floor but all she did was apologise and I had to ask her to get tissues and even show her there was a mess on the floor that needed to be cleaned. The food was cold, smelled off and was inedible so couldn't even eat it. But it also looked like prison food.  Getting out of there was a relief, in spite of having to wait 25minutes for the luggage to start moving on the luggage belt. All in all, I wouldn't recommend Air India Express even to my worst enemy.

Compensation for not boarding my family,Vacation00225709768,Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) - Dubai,"complaint and demand for compensation for not allowing my family (3 passengers) to not board our Air India Express flight on 11th August 2024.

I have made my complaint in air india express site and got case numbers 09056096, 09056093 but still no reply regarding this.

We booked a round trip ticket from DXB to TRV and back through CLEARTRIP MEA FZ LLC under the trip ID 230329300106 for the Air India Express flight IX 541. The ticket is attached below. PNR: NUPINL
Passengers: Ms JANAKI JOY JOSE , Ms PREETHA JOSE, Mr JAI GOVIND JOSE PREETHA (Child).

Our visa was valid till 23:59 11/08/2024, and we were returning back to UAE from Trivandrum to arrive at DXB by 19:45. We had enquired prior if there is any issue with traveling on the last day of visa expiry and booked a ticket that reached UAE about 5 hours before visa validity ended. Our new visas were already being processed.

We reached the airport early and were at the check-in counter by 13:30. We were informed by the check-in counter staff that mail needs to be sent to UAE for approval of our boarding passes due to ""APP error"" and that our luggage was 8kg overweight so we should transfer it to our hand luggage. So we moved away to transfer the same and had to stand in the queue for check-in again.

However at the check-in counter we were disappointed to know that the Air India Express staff had not sent any mail to UAE for approval yet and were told that our luggage was still 3kg overweight. We then paid Rs.3000 for it. We were asked to stand aside, and were denied our requests to speak to any supervisors/managers and to call and check with the UAE about the approval.

The Air India Express staff sent the mail to UAE only around 30 minutes before check-in closes, even though they were fully aware that the reply might take around 30 minutes. 5 minutes before check-in closed, we were told that we received approval from the UAE, only to then be informed that approval was given for only two passengers (JANAKI JOY JOSE and PREETHA JOSE) and that boarding had closed, so we could not board the flight.

During this entire process the staff was uncooperative, kept delaying, denied our requests, were rude and incompetent. The only staff member that actually cooperated was someone named Vishnu and he spoke with some higher official. The higher official was informed of this issue only around 15:30, even though we had been at the check-in counter requesting them to take action since 14:00. The staff also left without paying back the Rs.3000 paid for overweight baggage. We received no receipt for the same.

We then booked a flight with Air Arabia, and their staff contacted UAE. It was informed from UAE that approval had already been given for all 3 passengers after the mail was sent from Air India Express. But the Air India Express staff failed to verify the approval and enter it in the system to print the boarding passes. It was informed from UAE that there was no issue in availing the boarding pass. We booked the new ticket for Rs.1,41,000(Rupees one lakh forty one thousand) . The flight departed at 19:40 (3 hours after the departure of our initial Air India Express flight) and arrived in UAE around 22:00.

It is evident that there was no issue from UAE for boarding the flight on the last date of visa expiry. If a flight arriving in UAE 2 hours before visa expiry was approved, surely there would have been no issue with an Air India Express flight to allow the 3 passengers to arrive in UAE 5 hours before visa expiry.

It was very evident that the staff had no intention of helping us and had given false information that one passenger was not approved. Also note that when we enquired with customer service the next day, they said that we had missed the flight due to excess luggage and refused to acknowledge the visa issue entirely.

For the profound financial loss, mental and physical distress and inconvenience caused solely by the Air India Express ground staff we demand compensation. We demanded the Rs.3000 paid for extra baggage, the money paid for the Air India Express return flight we were not allowed to board and the 1,41,000 we consequently had to pay for the Air Arabia flight.

Else we will be filing a case in consumer court. We have decided to take whatever action required until this matter is resolved with enough compensation.",International,1.0,August 2024,24 August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Terrible Experience with Air India Express:   Canceled Seats, and Poor Service",Bhuvana J,Chennai (Madras) - Kuwait City,"I had a terrible experience with Air India Express on a flight from Chennai to Kuwait. I had booked seats in the front row and paid extra for them. However, the airline canceled the flight and rescheduled us on another one, but they also canceled our seats without refunding the extra amount we paid.

When we inquired about the seating issue at the airport, the staff were incredibly rude and refused to acknowledge their mistake. We requested either the front seats or a refund, but they were uncooperative and instead assigned us seats at the back of the plane.

To make matters worse, the staff were extremely slow in serving food, more interested in chatting among themselves than attending to passengers' concerns. The whole experience was frustrating, especially due to the poor management and the constant delays and cancellations.",International,1.0,August 2024,20 August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Complaint Regarding IX-383 Flight Delay from Mangalore to Dubai,sheik afraan a,Mangalore - Dubai,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the experience I had on flight IX-383 from Mangalore to Dubai on August 4, 2024. The scheduled boarding time was 8:10 AM, with departure at 9:10 AM. Unfortunately. After completing baggage check-in and immigration, we were informed of a technical issue with the aircraft. Initially, we were told the issue would be resolved in 30 minutes. However, it ultimately took over 7 hours to fix the problem. The delay was due to the unavailability of a spare part, which needed to be flown in from Mumbai. There was also a plan to fly the plane to Trivandrum for repairs, but this was changed after passenger objections.
1 Notification: While we understand that technical issues can arise, it is crucial to notify passengers as soon as possible. Had we been informed of the delay 3 to 4 hours before boarding, it would have spared many of us the hassle and stress of arriving early in the morning. Most passengers, traveling for work, could have used this time to rest and prepare for their next commitments, ensuring they could report to work refreshed the following day.
2) Key Personnel: There was a noticeable lack of trained staff available to manage the situation. Ground operations staff had no information, and there was no key personnel present to inform passengers about the delays. The situation became chaotic, and we had to demand to speak with the Air India airport manager before we received any accurate information. This delay in communication added to the frustration and confusion.
3) Process and Procedure: The entire situation could have been avoided if the issue had been detected earlier and communicated to passengers promptly. The technical and ground staff indicated that the problem was only detected during prechecks, despite the aircraft being in the hangar since 5:00 AM. This points to a lack of proper procedures and processes in place to identify and address issues in a timely manner. We can see the crew and the pilots arrived late as they were informed. This shows the care you give to your customer who spend their hard-earned money and choose Air India over other airlines to experience the worst service.",International,1.0,August 2024,5 August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

During this time, I approached several members of your staff for information and assistance. Regrettably, I encountered unhelpfulness, rudeness and lack of assistance.

I was asked to wait for 20mins as they wanted to reconfirm with ground staff though I showed my ticket to them.After long wait  they weren't able to provide with a acceptable solution instead they told me that i have to sit as per boarding pass even if i have paid for it. It caused me a lot of inconvenience as i was with my family. Though there were seats available in the same front row they refused to give us that seat and later after the take off they were selling that seat. Finally Station Manager arrived and instead of giving us a solution he was holding us responsible and force fully took the picture of our passport, which is against the rule of IATA.

Bad experience traveling in domestic flight,Nahdha W,Surat - New Delhi,"Very bad experience 

Travelled in Air India express AI 9085 - on 15th July - from Surat to Delhi.

It Started with the ground staff deducting priority payment twice from my card. 

First deduction saying he entered the wrong amount. Second deduction - I was told it‚Äôs not reflecting into their account. However, both amounts are deducted from my side and I am waiting for the refund. 

When I came to my seat - there was garbage left in the seat pockets. 
I went to the washroom and not a minute passed - the cabin crew started knocking the door loudly and non-stop  - when I opened she said it‚Äôs flight take off time !
- Okay, understandable. Although this could have been done in a polite manner.

I came back to my seat to find another passenger seated on it by the crew member! The passenger said he was sick and the crew let him take my seat !! . It was highly frustrating to see a sick passenger on my seat without even asking me once. 

When I confronted the crew, she just walked away to check with another crew and I was just standing there. 
Surprisingly, The flight started moving and I was still standing at the isle, waiting for them to resolve this. In the end they were asking me to move into other seat which was highly inappropriate and unprofessional.

However, I didn‚Äôt agree to this and got my seat back. 
During this journey I asked the crew member to bring me a cappuccino and she said we are about to land and she cannot bring it. 

We landed more than 45 mins of her saying that.

Given the circumstances‚Äîmy wife's pregnancy and our elderly family member's presence‚Äîwe hoped for empathy and support. We paid a premium fare, approximately 25,000 above the standard rate, yet our situation was handled dismissively. The airline rejected every request for assistance.

WORST AIRLINE AND WORST SERVICE!,Excursion14567179205,Hyderabad - Bengaluru,"I traveled with my grandparents and had the worst experience of my life, not just me but my grandparents also. We had pre-booked the wheelchair so that my grandparents dont face any difficulty during the onboarding process. Firstly, they allotted us female assistants for handling the wheelchair who could not pickup heavy luggages or handbags and they asked my grandfather to do so! He is 94 years old and without any shame she asked him to carry his own weights! DISGUSTING!! And while entering the aircraft, she asked my grandparents to get down from the wheelchair and walk till the seats. If my grandparents were in a position to walk and carry their weights why would they book a wheelchair. All in all, very PATHETIC SERVICE by air india. NEVER CHOSE THIS FLIGHT FOR TRAVELS.

Last time travelling with Air India and Air India express,Anish T,Abu Dhabi - Mumbai,"Very bad customer service by air india express team at abu dhabi airport. I booked my flight through clear trip and they said my surname missing. I told them this is how i travelled for 10 years and there is no specific mention of surname on cleartrip site. They said its cleartrip issue and cant allow me to board. When i asked for modify details they said through app its possible and when i tried it showed me option to modify but then showed regret as the flight was within 2 hours but actually as usual the flight was delayed by 1.5 hrs meaning there was more than 3 hours to correct the mistake. The guy at the counter was clueless and the Best part he also a rejected a family of 5 saying the same thing. The tickets for the family were booked by air india reservation team and they made the same mistake. When the staff understood customer was raising the concern of how air india staff themselves can make this mistake they allowed the family but didn't allow me saying its my mistake.
So if mistake is made my air india staff it can be corrected but mistake as they  by customers is not ok. They didnt even give me a refund. Air India and air india express staff needs to first learn what is customer service. New planes alone will not help. 

If you insist a mistake can cancel the trip then it should be applicable to everyone regardless who made the mistake.",International,1.0,May 2024,24 May 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Terrible,Trail67383387590,Bengaluru - Kozhikode,"### Review for Air India Express

""On May 22, 2024, I had a very disappointing experience with Air India Express on my flight from Bangalore to Calicut. The flight was scheduled to take off at 9:40 PM but was delayed and only took off at 1:40 AM, resulting in a delay of four hours. 

I had booked this flight specifically to reach my destination early, but the significant delay meant that my travel time ended up being longer than it would have taken by road. Adding to the frustration, when I approached the counter to get some food during the delay, I was informed that all the food was over. This meant enduring the four-hour delay at the airport without any provisions, which significantly disrupted my time and sleep.

This experience reflects very poorly on Air India Express, highlighting issues in both punctuality and customer service. I hope the airline takes serious steps to improve its services to avoid such inconveniences in the future.""",Domestic,1.0,April 2024,23 May 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The hand luggage issue was not mentioned anywhere on the ticket that the weight of the luggage should be 7kg, including the laptop. However, I confidently traveled with two laptops and their accessories, and it was sure to exceed the weight limit. I have been traveling for the last five years, and never before has an airport asked me to weigh my laptop bag. The lady at the C1 counter was very obstinate and unfriendly towards me and my husband. Furthermore, the lady supervisor, Upasana, treated us like criminals. Despite having done the web check-in, the staff's behavior was unacceptable. The whole experience was terrible and unacceptable.

I repeated her these words again with the by extending that life vest to her again. the smile disappeared from her face and she just handed the vest to her colleague. after some time the passenger occupied the seat which had no life vest under it. There was safety demonstration as usual. Flight took off and landed in Bangalore with one passenger without having a knowledge that there was no life vest under his seat.

Terrible experience with Air India Express STAFF  at the Cochin counter on 13th April 2024,Unquieadhi,Kochi (Cochin) - Dubai,"I am extremely disappointed with the staff behavior at the Air India Express check-in counter at Cochin airport. My flight to Dubai on 13th April 2024, flight no: IX435, was missed due to the staff's inefficiency and lack of professionalism.
Despite arriving only 15 minutes late for check-in, the staff refused to allow us to travel and claimed that it would be marked as a no-show flight. and we  missed the flight .This is unacceptable as the gate had not yet closed, and we were ready to board. The staff's behavior was rude and unhelpful, and they did not provide any customer service or assistance.
It is shocking to see that the staff at the counter did not follow proper procedures and did not assist us in completing the necessary exit formats. This lack of assistance led to us missing our flight and being left stranded at the airport.
Furthermore, it was disheartening to witness that the same staff helped another family with their check-in at the same time while refusing to assist us. This discriminatory behavior is unacceptable and highlights the incompetence of the Air India Express staff at Cochin airport.

Overall, my experience with Air India Express was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend this airline to anyone based on the poor behavior and lack of professionalism displayed by the staff. The staff at the check-in counter were unprofessional, unhelpful, and lacked any sense of customer service. It is concerning that they were not willing to accommodate us even when the gate had not closed and we were ready to board the flight. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the airline as a whole.

I hope that Air India Express takes this feedback seriously and works towards improving the behavior and professionalism of their staff at the Cochin airport. Passengers rely on airlines to provide a seamless travel experience, and incidents like this can greatly impact a passenger's perception of the airline.

Overall, my experience with Air India Express at the Cochin airport was extremely disappointing, and I would caution others to be wary of the staff's behavior when traveling with this airline.",International,1.0,April 2024,14 April 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A

4.No response to overhead yellow light in lieu of frivolous excuses when confronted...

Bad Experience,Aditi B,Jaipur - Goa,"Horrible, horrible experience. I don't even have words to express my hatred. The washroom was hardly available. There was nearly a line. To make it worse, apparently the toilet got clogged and it took them 5-10 mins to clean it up. I wont lie though, it was clean. Through 4 hours(connecting flights), we pressed the service bell thrice and not a single time did a staff member come to ask what was wrong or what they could provide. During the second flight, we waited half an hour for the food cart to reach us. When it did, the air hostess said she couldn't give us the food because we were too close to landing, as if that made any sense. So in simple words, you don't give us a chance to buy snacks when you're supposed  to?  Plus, the crew was extremely, and I mean extremely ignorant, demotivated and unprofessional. The was little to no legroom, and they said that they wouldn't allow me and my father to sit at the emergency area because I was underage(although that was one of the only things that made sense). Their application had a glitch,(as they themselves admitted at the entrance to the airport) so we were unable to choose our seats next to each other. My father was not OK with this, since he didn't want me to sit alone. The point is not if it was safe enough to sit next to a stranger, but the fact that the employees did nothing about it. They simply told us to ask someone if we could exchange seats. I understand that they might not have been able to do anything about it, but no one even  so much as apologized. Their cooks weren't exactly awesome either.

WORST AIRLINES IN INDIA,Rachna,Pune - Bengaluru,"I want to rate -100 to this scam of an airline. WORST ever. For reasons unknown to me, the special category booking was checked at the time i booked my flight (defence category) and not even a single time it warned me that i am booking under a special category . Nor did any kind of pop up showed up saying that if i do not produce a valid ID at the time of check in, i will be charged a fine of 2k per head per sector. 

Imagine my horror when i went to check in at the airport and the guy at the desk says that we need to pay 2000 per head bcaus we had booked in defence category apparently so had to shell out 4000 additional for my husband and me. I was concerned the same amount of fine will be applied on my return as well and so i asked him what can i do about it. The people at the desks are even more useless, they do not even know how their systems work. this fellow told that i can call customer care and get this code removed. the useless customer care (who call themselves customer happiness for no reason, probably they dont know the meaning of happiness)  told that no this cannot be done. 
We then were on our back and the same thing happened again. the lady at the desk said that we should have seen some kind of warning on the website before booking that you are booking in so and so category. I said no such thing appeared. she said sorry we cannot do anythng about it and we had to pay 4000 again for the return. total 8k on top of my already expensive air tickets. 
I would have rather flown 1st class on some other airline in this amount oif money than wasting it on this crap of an airline.
 I raised a complaint after reaching home through their website, but as expetced, the so called ""customer happiness"" rep denied giving the refund. They are not willing to admit they have such a big loophole in their system. they are literally looting in broad daylight . 
There is absolutely no mention of these fines on their website nor any warning or pop up that comes up before we book. some kind of check should be there in place saying you are booking in a special category so make sure you have the ID else be ready to pay the fine. I have not seen this crappy booking system in any other airlines in the country or in the world. 
This is the first time of my flying in last 20 years in india and abroad that i have got mad at an airlines. and no surprises, this was also my first time booking with this crap airline. i have learnt my lesson. absolutely no way i am going to book with this useless airlines ever again.

Airline scam,Ashwat S,Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) - Abu Dhabi,"Dear Team,

Thank you for reaching out . I would like to report an incident chain that took place with me and my mum when I travelled from TRV to AUH.

Tickets were booked and there was nothing mentioned that it would be via CCJ as you can see in the ticket attached which clearly shows that it is a 4 hour and 10 minutes flight.Moreover, even when we did the online check in and get the original boarding pass from the airport, nothing was mentioned that the flight was flying via CCJ.

In additional to all this, there was no announcement made in the flight regarding the flight destination,duration and ETA while taking off from TRV. The only time we found out was when the crew announced that the flight is landing in CCJ.

All this chaos and the airline staff had no decency to announce that the flight is going via CCJ.We were supposed to land AUH by 10:30pm on Feb25th UAE time but for your benefit and at our cost the flight landed on Feb 26th, 00:50am causing a delay of 2 hours and 20 minutes which is clearly not acceptable .

Also, chat with TIA is clearly not a feasible option.

Your actions will lead to a huge loss of customers for you if you continue to conceal information this way

It ranks as the worst I've ever encountered,Natasa D,Bengaluru - Pune,"My recent flight experience was absolutely dreadful. It ranks as the worst I've ever encountered. It all began with misinformation about which terminal I needed to be in. Despite being directed to Terminal 1, my flight was actually departing from Terminal 2, leading to a frantic rush between the distant terminals. This confusion resulted in me missing my flight entirely.

Upon being rebooked, I was shocked to discover that I was expected to pay double the original fare. This, despite the fact that my checked luggage, which should have been included, had been forgotten. It was an unnecessary hassle, particularly considering I was already dealing with the inconvenience of an injury and requiring wheelchair assistance.

Speaking of which, the wheelchair service I received was far from satisfactory. I found myself abandoned in crowded areas for extended periods, adding to the frustration of an already challenging situation. It took more than hour just to wait around and another to navigate through the airport.

When I sought assistance from the manager in securing access to a lounge during my lengthy layover, I was met with dismissiveness and indifference. Despite my numerous troubles, there was no sympathy or attempt to rectify the situation. Only one individual with Down syndrome was caring and professionally doing the work, among the otherwise uncaring staff.

In conclusion, my experience with this airline was a complete disaster. The combination of misinformation, extra charges, forgotten luggage, inadequate assistance, and overall rudeness from the staff leaves me with no choice but to advise against choosing this airline.

I asked her for Masala tea but when I was searching for my wallet to pay. I could not find it. So, I told her not to serve me ""I think I have left my wallet at the airport"".
I went on searching for my wallet within a few sec I found it.
When I asked her again for the masala tea again.  I could see, she was already making masala tea for me & she gave it to me.
I asked her do you take cash or a card? She just smiled & refused to take payment. I told her, I have found my wallet but still, she refused with her beautiful smile & asked me if i am hungry or need anything.I was like wowww.
It just touched my heart‚ô•Ô∏è.By the way it was not about the free tea.

She is a very kind person with a beautiful soul. She seriously stole my heart.She deserves that rank & she is doing her Job beautifully.

1.  Issue started when I was doing web check in. I selected the seats while booking the tickets and got the confirmation too. While doing the web check-in, there was an option for VIP seats. Just out of curiosity, I clicked that link to know price of upgrade. Instantly, they put the price tag on ticket and showing INR 4200 pending and I have to pay them to get the boarding pass. On their web check-in portal, there is no option go back or cancel the upgrade. Once you click it, you have to pay it. I thought, I will get the boarding pass from the counter, but shockingly, counter staff got rude that i have to pay the remaining amount otherwise they will cancel the ticket. They even said that i have done the partial payment while booking the ticket. I mean WTF man, how can someone do the partial payment on your portal, like pay 70% now and rest 30% at counter. Is it like a LALA company or what. What a big SCAMMERSS.

2. Anyways, after all these ruckus, I got the best seats they have to offer, front row seats etc etc. On their portal, they mentioned complementary drinks and food for VIP ticket holders. I asked for food and drinks, they again said, I have to pay for food or drinks and order that separately. SCAMMMMM.

Waiting for improvement,VeedonFleece,Sydney - New Delhi,"My recent experience with Air India on a flight from Sydney to New Delhi left much to be desired. Despite the efforts of the staff within their limitations, the overall journey felt like a chaotic ordeal.

The cleanliness standards fell short, with staff seemingly clocking off well before the flight‚Äôs conclusion, compromising the end-to-end customer experience. The Head Air Steward appeared preoccupied with Business Class passengers, leaving the rest of us wondering about his effectiveness, and some lady fashionably dressed in an ankle length red dress, for  the same time. Not sure what her role was, sleeping during a 12 hr flight?

Additionally, the state of the toilets deteriorated rapidly throughout the flight.

Entertainment options were promising, with a selection of superb films, but unfortunately, technical issues plagued the system, rendering it unusable after repeated resets.

Communication from the Captain was minimal, with only a brief introduction at the beginning and silence until announcing landing preparations. His apparent prioritization of business class passengers further highlighted a lack of consideration for all travelers.  He made sure he was off the flight with them. Sort of guy you would not like to have been on the Titanic.

Despite these shortcomings, Air India may be the only direct option for travel to New Delhi from Sydney, leaving passengers with little choice.

The worst decision of my life to book air india express to and fro,Vishnu Satis,Bengaluru - Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum),"The worst experience I have ever had in a flight journey.
First of all the flight was delayed by 3 hours atleast. Unfortunately i hate to say that, thats not the worst part.

I can understand that flights can get delayed due to safety reasons and unprecedented scenarios, but the communication from the ground staff was pathetic.
We were sent to flight through the walkway/bridge, and they made us to stand there for 30 mins without giving a reason. There were passengers holding babies and old people too. Until the passengers started protesting, no body even cared to take any steps any further steps, but just to make us wait. If it were upto the ground staff we would have been standing there god knows how much.
After telling us that they cant board ua , they were also not able to take ua back to the waiting area, now we are sitting on ground, enough people to fill a flight all sitting on ground. Then they made us to finally go to waiting area on the other aide of the gate, but after making us sit on the floor for another 30 mins, but through transfers gate, were we had to go through security check again. 

Secondly nobody was given proper briefing  about what the procedure for second time security check was and how to navigate through the situation and which terminal to reach. We told by the security at the check that we cant go in with old boarding pass. After 15 mins of confusion a staff made us go through the security check gate, with old boarding pass. 

After all this when we reached the gate, nobody new at the gate about thia incident, they are confused and making calls, and there was another delay of 2 hours. Finally we reached trivandrum at 3 am. Instead of 11.

To the common man, please dont book this flight of any of the flights from them. 

To air india, Please hire some competent ground staff or passengers are going to be pissed. In flights delays constant communication with the customer is a must.

It exceeded the 7 kg but as laptop weight shouldn‚Äôt be included in this allowance, I thought it‚Äôs okay to exceed.

I rather take a bus than fly this crappy airline.,uday029,Bengaluru - Hyderabad,"Avoid at all costs, even when Air India Express (AIE) costs 40%-50% less compared to other airlines. This is the worst airline for any domestic travel within India. They run the same one flight between various cities through out the day. If the first flight is delayed then all the subsequent flights see exponential delays. Even in case of general airport related delays, AIE gets the least priority among all other airlines. So if there is a weather related delay, all other airlines still experience lower delay than AIE. 

Their customer service is non-existent. If by a miracle, you get a hold of a human representative, they just repeat the information that one can find online. They are east bothered to help the passenger. Avoid this airline if you value your time. 

The fleet is quite old with wear and tear clearly visible. Many things inside the flight are held together by duct tape (such as hand rests, sliced seat cushions etc). The flight itself is very dirty due to its old age. These guys cram as many seats as possible so the legroom is pathetic.

If you enjoy sitting in a dump full of urine, stains, and garbage, then this airline is the one for you. TV's don't work (though, you wouldn't want to touch them anyway, unless you're prepared to be hospitalized with disease). The drinks weren't served until 3 hours into the flight. I asked for a diet coke from 3 various so-called crew members, and none brought me one. I gave up. The table didn't really work anyway, so had the diet coke come, it would have spilled. 

Check in took nearly 2 hours in queue. I was a few KG's over with my carry-on, so got billed 25,000 INR to check it in. And had the check in not taken two hours, I would have happily found alternative arrangements. The payment for the 'overweight bag' took an additional 30 minutes because the employees were sitting on their phones and really didn't give a rats a$$ about their job. When complained about the time, they said they're short staffed. As a friendly reminder, India has 1.3 billion people and I know many who would love the job. 

This was truly the worst flying experience I've ever had. I have Star Alliance Gold and I can unequivocally say, without a shadow of doubt, this was the most disgusting and unprofessional flight I've ever had. Ryan Air is now considered a 5 Star business class airline. Thank you Air India for representing your beautiful country so horrendously.

She already cancelled the air india express  ticket and indigo did not prove the seat or tickets ....

My question is if they know that the flight has been delayed, why are they still showing original time and taking money for a false booking.

I had added an extra 10kg of luggage to my booking, but I was unable to make the payment online. The portal showed that I owed 200 SAR, but when I arrived at the airport, the staff member informed me that he could not accept the payment and that I needed to pay the airport baggage fee.

"Safety and Security of Woman travelers, and Speed of Action on Complaints",Chandran R,Bengaluru - San Francisco,"Dear All,

What I'm writing about is something which happened to me and I'm very happy that Air India Express Management, CEO Sri. Aloke Singh, CoHR Mr. T Vijaykrishnan, and Deputy HR Dr. Satheesh Nair and many top officials of Air India, took such an apt and timely decision to solve the matter. 

One of the employees of AIEL misbehaved with me, I was hesitant to report, but it was inevitable that at the advice of my husband I reported. Within a fortnight all the disciplinary actions were taken and the staff was terminated from employment. The confidence it has reposed in my family and my extended family members, friends and colleagues is really very high. 

If all the airlines look into such intricate issues to its miniscule depth then we women travelers need not worry about our safety because at the back of our mind it settles that there are responsible people in the airlines who take care of our safety and security. One thing I would like to state is most of the organizations that preach about women safety and security, but AIEL, AIR India and Tata's have proved that they care for we women travelers. Thanks AIEL, AI and TATA Group for upholding the code of conduct discipline.

Extremely poor service - avoid travelling by air India express.,Mohammad B,Mumbai - Dubai,"PNR X11E52
IX 247
BOM-DXB

The flight bound to depart by 3:00PM was first delayed by 3 hours 30 mins due to Dubai runway closer or something. After boarding l the flight with the delayed time at 6:25pm we were informed that the flight is having technical issues and needs fixing - which will take 1 hour. However the technical issue took longer than 1 hour to fix. Meanwhile there was significant confusion amongst the fellow passengers. Different information being flown in by different individuals. After a lot of confusion everyone had to de-board the flight and re-board again! It is already 9:00pm now and the flight hasn‚Äôt yet taken off! All this while we were given some meal option at the lunch time that too felt more like check list thing, food served was cold. So far after that there is only water provided by the team! I wonder how long one is suppose to starve before serving something decent to eat. 

Now this overall delay and poor show of service has caused significant loss to my planned business upon arriving in Dubai on time. I started last night at 12:00AM from my home town travelling more than 800km from my hometown and have not reached the destination so far (which is 9:00pm).

When i bought the seat I was not told about this, like how they specify emergency exits. I was then asked to keep the box in a space about 5 rows behind.

Horrible ground staff,Saniha Ajith,Doha - Kochi (Cochin),"I have heard about the horrible customer service of Air India Express before but have never experienced it until recently. I was flying on Air India Express from Doha to Cochin on Feb 24, 2022. At the check in counter at Hamad International Airport, I encountered the most rude staff ever. On showing my full vaccination certificate (Covishield from India with QR code), they claimed this is not the right certificate, since it only showed the date of second dose, not the first dose. (Isn't it obvious I have taken the first dose if second dose is valid??) Also, in my certificate printout, our PM Modi's picture was not printed clearly and they raised an issue stating 'where is Modi's picture? This is not authentic'. Does the airline really validate vaccination certificates based on Modi's photo rather than the valid QR code right next to it? When I tried to calmly explain that I travelled to Doha 2 months earlier with the same certificate and had no issue, the staff told me not to 'argue' and would not even bother listening to me. He demanded I show him the date of first dose or I cannot board the flight. Luckily, I had my laptop with me and I could access the first dose certificate in a couple of minutes. But the basis on how Air India Express staff check vaccination certificates and the way they speak to their customers is absolutely pathetic and inhumane.

"Insensitive, money-minded and outright disgusting",Indh Diya,Chicago - Chennai (Madras),"Due to issues with delayed RT-PCR testing, I was required to postpone my flight by one day, as were my peers.

The customer service is not aware of anything about the company, and has as much information as the customer, if not less.
They kept connecting us to the ticketing department, who would then not pick up. So I called 24 people 24 times and got sent to the ticketing department, where I was on hold, once for a period of 55 minutes, until the call was abruptly ended without my consent. I tried multiple devices and cried over the phone because I needed the money that I spent on the flight ticket not to go to waste, and all I needed was a reschedule by a day. The customer service is working from home and has NO INFORMATION. This is a pathetic situation, and I lost my savings on trying to get home.

Please don't get confused with AIRINDIA and EXPRESS air India they both are different and it's a TRAP if you just blindly go with the names. As EXPRESS intentionally kept a similar name to gather customers on the name and credibility of AIRINDIA.

Because of lack of knowledge of the staff and its the airlines' way of making money by overbooking and cancelling or didn't allow some of the passengers when the boarding starts by informing them the QR code is missing from the RT PCR test on 21/04/2021 at 8:00 am.
QR Code is MANDATORY on the RT-PCR report from 22nd Morning neither from 21st Morning.
I had requested and shown the so-called ground staff adamant Manager Dharmesh  ""SIR, these RT PCR report of COVID-19 is given to me by authorized Govt. test center in BHOPAL.

Hence, I don't need one currently to board on the flight.
He started arguing and challenging that I don't care about the Govt. in BHOPAL I need the QR Code on the form so that you can board.
It was 8:30 am I requested my DAD to hurry up to the hospital snd request them to grant me one as the illiterate manager with LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ain't willing to understand anything. 
My MUM Passed away on 16th April and it's like a vicious circle because one issue or the other just coming in front of me and the managers like DHARMESH who is a curse on airindia EXPRESS had tarnished the company's image that it can't be bloomed.
I lost my Fight from BOM-DXB-OTP-LHR and it was very important for me to reach London before 24th APRIL as the Govt. of the UK was closing borders and INDIA would be placed on RedZone and also self-paid hotel quarantine for ¬£1750 plus if enter on 24th April after 4:00 am.
I had him crystal clear; If I can't board ""SIR DHARMESH"" on the flight I could probably lose my job in the UK and also the quarantine package money would go in vain.
It's like I was talking to a WALL.
The ground reality is EMIRATES staff said the documents I had are more than enough for me to travel.
Actual; AIRINDIA Manager in the evening Mr. John said the documents you possess are alright to travel and SPICEJET too allowed me to travel and I did at night but it was too late for me to travel and I missed my whole itinerary; including the quarantine package money. 
But they cannot issue me a ticket as the gates already closed and the emirates flight for Dubai was about to shoot off.
Again, I literally went back to EXPRESS airindia. The same manager didn't allow me to board. The website of EXPRESS of airindia wasn't even working, and he insisted me to go and check the website which I had all screenshots and all the recording of other AIRLINES which I would produce in court.
It's an AIR TRIP SCAM and it needs to be exposed or else common people like us will always suffer by the hands'of some bunch of crooks of People like airindia ground staff manager ""DHARMESH""",International,1.0,April 2021,30 April 2021,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"Ravi and Krishan HARASS me at dubai airport cancelled my flight and charged me 768aed, broke my luggage.",Rochelle Harman,Dubai - Jaipur,"I am Bhavana Thapa, on 13th march I booked a flight from Dubai to Jaipur (AI1928)
When I went for check in, she checked my baggage was 28kg, hand luggage was not checked. During boarding they checked my luggage was 14kg with a laptop.
While boarding they asked me to pay for 4kg extra baggage, i went to Dubai duty free to return the alcohol¬†so that i could pay for the extra luggage charges, after returning
the alcohol my hand baggage was 12kg including laptop. I couldn't leave my bag because it had 2laptop. He asked me to pay still for 4kg.
Mr. Ravi took the boarding pass and said if you are not ready to pay you can't go and started tiering off my boarding pass and used abusive language in his language, didn't let me fly.
He cancelled my flight, I was begging to go because it was an emergency and there was no other flight for Jaipur.
Dubai Police and security came and start asking everything to everyone what happened. They called Mr. Ravi and asked him to arrange next flight for me.
The solution given by Mr. Ravi was you go to Chennai because there is no other flight for India for now or wait at the airport till 14th 12:15pm for next flight which goes to Delhi.
At the same time he shared duty number which is +971-504557580. I started calling him from 6am on the same number ""Nobody answered"", At last Mr. Krishan answered at 9.45am.
And made an statement ""I don't have any information about whatever happened last night and the flight AI1930 going to Delhi at 12.15 is already full"". For the flight he will confirm
with the airport manager hence there is nothing to do with Dubai airport manager. when I asked him to let me speak to me, He denied neither he let me speak with Ravi.

(I have his recording)
I went to Dubai police to complain that he is changing the statement.
He came to meet at boarding point and started shouting that ""Why did you complain to Dubai police and if you do this we will not let you fly( start harassing me)
He forced me to write a letter (letter is in attachment) His statement ""you can't record anything and until you will not write this letter you can't fly.
Finally I took the flight of AI1930 which took my to Lucknow then to Delhi. 
(also not informed by the air India's staff.)

When I reached at the Delhi airport, Baggage counter told me to pay 768Aed/15210rs for off loading changes otherwise I will not get my bag.
I spoke to the manager Mr Chandra Mohan and he clearly asked me to pay and write a complain because he can't help me in this because he received an email from dubai air india
staffs where its mention that Air india has to charge me 768aed/15210rs for my baggage. I paid and got the receipt (Attached ) where its nothing mention that I paid for off loading
charges.

I chat with Dnata team where they say Dnata didn't charge me any fee hence Air India charged me in behalf of Dnata. (Chat Attached)

Now My complain is for the staff Mr. ravi and Krishan who misbehaved with me, wasted my time and took my 15210rs/768aed still my baggage is broken and nobody is taking any responsibility.

Indians are famous for many things,which include very poor service,incorrigible attitude,egoistic(never understood the reason) and going for cheap products.
Air India Express is clearly marring India's image and yet there is not a single person within the 1.2B who cares and wants to improve its service.If there are still indians who care for India,please do not support Air India Express,we have to work towards its demise and its riddance for good.

Worse experience,Parul S,Jebel Ali - Mumbai,"Noorjahen & Sherry were the air hostesses from dubai to Mumbai very bad experience: 
Never again in Air India Express:
Started from the time i went into the check in line at Mumbai Int.Airport on 11dec flying to Dubai. The guy who was standing to guide people where to go i told him i had a silver card so he asked me to go to the first counter. (Neither of us were aware that silver card doesnt work in low budget airline i was told later) 
The girl at the counter was not polite & asked me who sent me here & i said 1 of your staff member. She told me to go to the normal line not in a polite tone.
When i was going to the line another staff member told us to go on the opposite side counters as was less line. Again i said i was silver card holder he sent me the 1st counter on that side & all went smoothly. 
Dubai to Mumbai on 19 December was a bigger disaster. 
As soon as my husband & I boarded the flight i asked for 2 pillows & 2 blankets. The air hostess told me she will give us after take off. She did come & give 1 pillow & 1 blanket. I asked for another one for my husband. She said she will get it shortly. She & her colleague passed a few times & i must have asked 4-5times. The last time i asked she said she has distributed it all & i was talking to her saying i asked before & before i completed she just walked away. How can she do that! 
Her colleague gave me water she had filled it so much that i went to keep it on the tray table it all fell I immediately told her all fell want more she didnt even have the courtesy to ask if i needed any tissues or something to wipe as it had fallen on my pants.
There were no immigration forms for non Indian passport holder come on its an international flight you need to keep them.

"Terrible airline, planes, staff.",Hussain Al Nahla,Dubai - Kozhikode,"In my life, travelled by more than 10 different airlines. Sometimes I thought some of the airline are bad, but I never seen very bad service like this airline.
The first impression is when you arrive to the plane door, the crew stands on one corner chatting and totally ignoring arrived passengers. Easily you can notice how the plane is dirty from inside. One of crew was (shouting) to a passenger because he is using mobile phone while we still on the ground. The way they deliver the food to the passengers was really rude and it like that though the food on the table and go away. The most bad action was to close the front WC and keep it for their own use and they direct passengers to the rear WC even if they sets on the front raw. Later on one of the crew started having her food and the food smell was really bad, she sets in the front raw and starts her meal without considering the passengers.
I though this attitude from some of the staff but unfortunately it looks like it is a common practice as on the way back we faced almsot the same attitude.

Back to Air India Express,chackoka,Kochi (Cochin) - Singapore,"Yes, I am writing about the Air India Express (AIE) once again.

Since I wrote the last review, I travelled several times to Singapore ‚Äì frankly, I lost count ‚Äì and most of them were on Air India Express. Everything I wrote last time still holds good. My appreciation only increased each time I travelled. It is a budget airline ‚Äì actually, the fare a notch below most of the budget airlines in this sector ‚Äì with service a notch above the full-service airlines.

The cabin service deserves special appreciation. The crew goes out of the way to provide service par excellence. On a recent flight to Singapore, I went to the galley to pick up an extra copy of the Singapore immigration form. The parser who handed over the form seemed hurt, and he said that I should have just pressed the overhead chime and they would have provided what I wanted at my seat. I have never heard that in any other airline cabin or galley. I did not tell him that I hate to summon the staff to my seat, and as much as possible, I avoid that.

There are two issues I would like an answer from AIE:

One disappointment is that the airline has no frequent-flyer program. I do not know why.

Another mystery is the allotment of seats. Everyone knows that aircraft cabins have more-comfortable and less-comfortable seats. Airlines allot the coveted bulkhead seats (the so-called cradle seats) and the emergency-exit seats, based on payment or the frequent-flyer status. In all the Cochin ‚Äì Singapore flights I took, the seat allocation was a mystery. I could not select the seat on the web when booking or later, or at the check-in counter.

Air India Express owes an explanation as to the basis of seat allocation.",Southeast Asia,5.0,September 2019,11 October 2019,4.0,4.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

An International Budget Air Liner - Air India Express,MPG Nair,Muscat Governorate - Kochi (Cochin),"This was my maiden flight by Air India Express (IX 442 - seat 3 C -19-04-19) during my last 25 years of stay abroad and now I feel why I missed such a majestic carrier all these days and therefore I have returned by IX 549 seat 3C on 28-04-19 also.

At the outset I was impressed by the rates which are very competitive and I have observed that the ""early birds"" could still benefit cheaper rates.

The service provided by the crew and the entire ground staff have been so cordial, which are really commendably worth the value of the money spent and are comparable if not much superior to those offered by other air liners in this sector.

Air India Express also offers a variety of food for your choice at a very reasonable additional charge which also is very competitive 

I, therefore, have decided to travel in Air India Express in future --
and have booked my next travel also with them to Enjoy Air India Exp on 27-06-19 on IX 554 seat 4C and return on 02-07-19 by IX 549 seat 4C..

Notwithstanding the above, I would still appeal to the management of Air India Express to initiate suitable actions to avoid any possible last minute cancellation of flights as I understand from previous press notes and mitigate the avoidable severe inconvenience to the customers / passengers which include families, children and infants. though I have not been in part of any such inconvenience attributable to Air India Express. Such an endevour will ensure a profitable steady growth to Air India Express

The check in was a breeze, the staff were courteous and the in flight experience was pleasant. The do offer a complimentary snack box that contained a samosa, cheese sandwich, cake and banana chips along with Coffee/tea. Compare this with Scoot/Air Asia that charge for a glass of water!

The fare is unbelievably low. Period. The Cochin ‚Äì Singapore flight was a comfortable 10.30 AM ‚Äì 17-30 PM affair. (We hate night, especially late night, flights.) The return flight timing was not convenient, though. It was late night.

We fly frequently between Cochin and Singapore. And, over the years, we have flown in almost every airline that operates in the route. No airline, including the full-service ones, could match the timing, convenience, the fare and, defiantly, the service of the Express.

The aircraft we flew from Cochin to Singapore had a stop at Madurai, but that is a technical detail. We stayed in the aircraft cabin. The return flight was through Bangalore, and there too we stayed in the aircraft.

The Cochin ‚Äì Singapore 737 cabin was shabby, no doubt, but the service made up for that. Unlike the other budget-airline service, Express offer complimentary snakes. We opted for paid-for lunch, and we were happy that we did. The lunch when served was piping hot, and the food was, well, delicious.

Alcohol, understandably, is not served complimentary. But it was available for purchase. The options are limited to Black Label scotch and Bacardi white rum. Price is steep, Bacardi 50 ml Rs.400, and Black Label Rs.500. No club soda is available. But the cabin crew was ready to provide ice and water.

The return flight was through Bangalore. The aircraft cabin was much better and the service was the same, superb. This flight too kept the time.

It is a great pleasure to fly Ait India Express. Whenever possible, I would fly Air India Express.",Southeast Asia,4.0,January 2019,17 February 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
Appreciating good staff,Avijit Das Patnaik,Bengaluru - Singapore,"AI Express is a budget airline so one must compare it today with Jet Airways or Indigo flying on the same route. I had a lovely checkin experience at Blr where although the queue was long, my man Chaitanya Charan Mahapatra ensured I get a seat with next two seats empty so that I can sleep. Also my suitcase lock wasn‚Äôt functioning so he went out of his way and got a strong string tied to the zipper handles & then sealed with a sticker so that no one opens it and I feel safe. Plus had a smile on his face.

Flight was take off was smooth, seats were better than Indigo, food was better than jet airways. In my order of preference amongst these three, Jet will be last.

Currently check

very pathetic service,p_Pooja10,Amritsar - Dubai,"Very pathetic service of air india express in every way. Below are the points 
1. After booking tge ticket from their portal, there was no one to clarify any query. Call centres doesn‚Äôt pick up the call. Tried dialing both indias and dubais office- no response
2. The flight got delayed by more than 7 hours. The total time it takes to reach dubai is 3 and half hours and total time to wait is 9 hours as people reach early too for international flights
3. No proper meals given to passengers. some sandwiches and a sugared drink was only offered. What about patients with diabetes. What about unlimited water. A water bottle at airport cost around 60 to 100 inr. 
4. No staff to resolve queries of passengers stranded at airport. 
5. No one either at call center or office picked up passengers call. At last it is an airline by corrupted management. So nobody cares

Wish to congratulate a team who took control and responsibility of the situation and did all they could to make passengers comfortable¬†

Special mention goes to Azzan alwaihibi ( ground handling staff ) who stood all day with passengers even without food - until 10.00 pm till all passengers were accomodated .

Special need passengers were given special care and AirIndia ( mr Mahesh , rafath and team ) was exceptional in there support and genuine efforts.

Congratulations to all on how you managed an incident which could have been mishandled and could have created bad reputation¬†

'Things could go wrong , it is always how you manage it ' that determines the result

AirIndia express-A Horror Movie-Doha to Mumbai,abhishekdey2015,Doha - Mumbai,"AirIndia wasn't my first choice of airline.Usually, when looking for airlines to fly, I'm searching up and down the list of consumer-aviation from Qatar. This trip was mostly like a horror movie. The start-Flight was precisely 1 hour late on 11th Jan 19 (AI9002). Was Quite patient with the waiting time. Then it all started. Here‚Äôs the list of flaws: Poor Hygiene in the washroom. No head napkin/hygiene cloth on top of the seat(absolutely unacceptable as lot of people might carry dandruff etc..). Dinner- A nightmare and I must elaborate with complete respect by saying Management is least bothered with regards to the quality of food, NO EXPIRY DATE LABEL on food(Absolutely unacceptable.It‚Äôs simply criminal). Pictures attached. Asked the staff and all that they have to say is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our standard‚Äù. I replied ‚Äú It‚Äôs my right to know the manufacturing date and the date of expiration‚Äù. Eyebrows up and rolling eyes is all I got. Staff looked helpless as they had no answer and hid themselves behind the curtain and never came out to clarify further. 
I request the management to please read this very seriously and change if not improve immediately the way of operations. It‚Äôs my right to have a great experience leave beside the money paid for the ticket. I do not expect a Qatar Airways service but at least please try and get close to them to make all happy who chooses you. Take customers seriously Please !! 
On the contrary the flight from Mumbai to Kolkata was excellent. Professional staff. Good Breakfast (Again label missing). Honestly this flight made some good service recovery. Thanks !!

AFFORDABLE BUDGET FRIENDLY FLIGHT,Rajan V Kokkuri,Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) - Muscat Governorate,"I had purchased excess 10 KG baggage through online at nominal cost and it was helpful. In addition to I had 5 KG excess baggage which I paid through credit card. Tvm airport departure terminal do not have sufficient ATM's. One ATM only was available which I found not working. 
If online web check-in is available then crowd in the Que can be reduced.
Service was good wth friendly staff at counter and in side Aeroplane. I had ordered extra breakfast. They do provide a small breakfast and that is good enough for good break. In the recent past I flew Air India express and found it reliable plus very friendly to date change facility with minimum charge. Air India Express allow 30KG luggage allowance from Muscat and Dubai and this is very useful for people like me. Make sure you carry the credit card from which you made booking, or copy of the credit card with stricked back side no. with authorization from the credit card holder.
I found a Oman Visa copy of a passenger in the Que and handed over to staff which was very helpful since I saw a passenger searching for the print later.
My advise is to the new passengers to carry visa copy and all important papers copies carefully and also keep an additional set in another bag for emergency. Do not place Battery Pack in checked in lugguage. Ticket cancellation and refund facility is also good with Air India Express. My sincere request to Airlines is that try to start a direct Muscat -Bengaluru flight in the future.",International,3.0,September 2018,17 September 2018,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Mumbai airport is too congested,Srinivas K,Hyderabad - Mumbai,It's always common observation that flights from Air India to Mumbai before landing roam around in the air waiting for their turn even though they take off before time or on time from the origin. Mumbai airport is operating at 200% of its capacity and making world records for wrong reasons. Tons of fuel is burnt in the air by the queuing flights before landing near the airport.

seats are quite uncomfortable and leg space is less and cleanliness is pathetic. Overall it was average flight. the crew was good and managed very well when we were waiting for the aircraft to take off.

Worst Travelling Experience I have had,sonalijain3110,New Delhi - Vadodara,"I had booked a flight from New Delhi to Vadodara (AI 819) for 27th May, ETD -1750 ( booking was actually confirmed on 27th April - A month prior to date of travelling)
On reaching airport at 1650 hours, I was told that the flight was overbooked, and no seats available. 
Worst part was that I had to literally shout and request for attention towards the situation and was made to to wait for more than 30 minutes at the checkin counter.

I was given only two options, either travelling 24hrs later or to travel via ahmedabad. Since I had to reach office next morning, I had no option but to chose the second one. A flight at 1945 hrs via Ahmedabad was arranged, which apparantly got delayed and actually flew at 2115 hours (1.5 hours delay)

I have landed up reaching Vadodara at 0115 hours in the night, at an unnecessary additional expense. 
My entire day has been ruined because of poor services by Air India

The crew at the check in counter were not even kind enough to talk with a solution, where I could see 2 more passengers who were also supposed to travel to Vadodara via same flight. They did not show basic courtesy, and mentioned to write ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù in the feedback.

Terrible ground staff and plane condition,Mohit B,Dubai - Mumbai,"Even though it'll be a shame that our national carrier gets sold to a foreign/private airline but I think that's the only way to get some of these government staff to start working and the condition of their planes/infrastructure/service to improve.
It's a shame that an entire Government department/ministry can't run an airline!!!

This level of service is highly unacceptable and unprofessional. Being a budget carrier does not give you the liberty to treat your customers in such a careless and unprofessional way. I need a compensation for the delay in baggage which is clearly due to mismanagement. This is something that should be made aware to the passenger before he/she is taking the flight and not upon arriving at the destination.

A Decent Flight,Rajesh A,Dubai - Pune,"Have had the need to travel to Pune often - and direct flights are far and few.. AI Express is one of them that provides a direct connection to Pune from Dubai..

The best part about AI Express is the timing. Leaves Dubai at around 10 AM and reaches Pune by 2 PM. If all goes well and you are travelling light - one can be out in 30 Mins flat.. My best was 7 minutes - but must say, I was sitting on the first seat, hence was out first - first at immigration and since I was travelling light - just sailed through.

No frills airline - Don't expect luxury - it is not meant for it. It is very convenient for short distances - How many people want to plan their life in 3 hours. Gives you sufficient time to relax / read a book / listen to some music and you are at your destination. 

The bad is the seats - very little cushioning - so your butt if you do not have enough fat on you - can hit the metal under the seat. If they can fix that, very convenient. Not that AI Express cannot afford it - the price of the ticket is not exactly in the cheap category - so why are they called Budget Airline - I have always wondered.

The Service - nothing much to rave home about - they are a bit stingy when it comes to giving water - Don't know why they cannot distribute bottles especially when they carry small ones. The seats for me are a bit cramped - I can blame my height for it - but the best part I love about AI Express is the time. I can leave Dubai in the morning - reach my hotel by 3. Relax for an hour and be back on mails... If they can make it at 6 AM - perfect. I think they can get the entire business traveler section on their flight. Departure from Pune again - a bit odd timing - leaves at 5 - hence do not prefer them on return. Make it at 8 PM - perfect...

Bad service,Harsharn R,Sydney - New Delhi,"Dear Air India Authorities 
I was traveling via Air India Flight AI301 from Sydney to New Delhi on 21st march at 10.45 am with my two children,one of them ailing with a fever that measured 101.this is by far the worst travel experience I have ever had thanks to two of your crew members.these women were rude,arrogant and unprofessional.First encounter of mine with their unprofessionalism happened when I politely requested them to dispose off the soiled diapers thrown inside a tied plastic trash bag.I had assumed that they would because I have always been assisted with the same in many other airlines.However,I was told that it was not their job to do that and that I must dispose them off in their bathroom.I went in the bathroom and found that the bins were filled and I decided to keep the trash bag with me as my elder sick child was following me around and my younger child's soiled diaper needed my urgent attention.After finishing the chore of changing and disposing the diaper and soothing my crying children WITHOUT EVEN AN OFFER FOR HELP despite having people for help around,I earned some mean and snide remarks that's i should have checked other 4 bathroom to dispose them off, carrying my crying baby in hand other sick one running after me ,isn't it their duty to maintain the toilets bins instead me looking for any available vacant toilets .when I told their senior air hostess that I had difficulty in dumping the rubbish with one child in lap another one in my hand she told me it's my responsibility to do that . Yes , indeed it's my kids and my job but what's your job then ? Meanwhile I also needed to get the baby bottles washed. I decided to do it on my own and Guess where was I directed to-the bathroom! Doesyour airline prepare the food in the bathrooms as well? Because the ease with which I was told so suggests that you guys give two hoots and a damn to cleanliness and hygiene.I think it was my fault to expect something so standard from the airlines which doesn't even provide Child Restrain Belts for childrens' safety.

A lot more can be done,Abhishek Menon,New Delhi - Dubai,"This review with the above headline is for the airline as a whole and not for the flight attendants. 4 stars given is validated below as per my personal experience.

The flight from Dubai took off on time and reached Delhi 15 minutes earlier than scheduled. The journey was very smooth right from take off till landing. 

Pros :
1. Food is served for free although its a low cost airline. It has a bottle of water, a samosa, sandwich, chips and a cake ; more than sufficient for this 2hrs 40 minutes flight.
2. Check in was smooth
3. Flight was on time.

Cons :
1. Our suitcases were handled like a sag filled with waste material being dumped at a junkyard. We saw this through the window helplessly. The bags received were full of scratches and marks.
2. Aircraft from inside was in poor condition and not maintained at all. Seats were torn.
3. You cant web check in, so reach the boarding pass counter as early as possible to get a preferential seat.
4. You would not get a warm welcome but a feeling that this is just another flight for the attendants.
5. I am not comparing here about the crew members of wrt other airlines as it may not help much unless you have an intent to smile from your heart to your customers.
6. No in flight entertainment.

Also note that the terminal for Air India express is T-2 along with low cost airline fly dubai and other small airlines.

* On Boarding it was obvious the plane was very old, and very dull
* Seats were uncomfortable, and the upholstery was worse for wear
* The fixtures and fittings around my seat were broken, or cracked, which no doubt would be dangerous for a minor
*  Windows were dirty, and very sticky
* The carpets were worn out, and had holes

Chekin Staff  Cabin Crew staff - They are all very friendly and they are performing well in their Duties.

Snaks and food Served aboard - They are good and acceptable refreshments.

Refund Policy and customer care service- Very pathetic. I Booked tcket from chennai to Singapore During Dec 2015 when chennai was about to flood. The Air india express closed their shop and no information was being circulated to me mentioning whether the flights will fly or cancelled.

and they did not give back my 7000 INR when we cancelled the flights because of no information was available. where as other airlines were readily refunded money with out any kind of charges or processing fees.

How they handle checkin baggage - My flight landed in Tiruchiirapally en-route to Singapore and my seat happens to be on the cargo hold entry door. the ground handling staaf just throw the luggaage in a very harsh maner as if they are throwing some garbage bags. and whole flight was shaking because of this rash handling.

Over all opinion  - This airline is not even for booking when you dont have any option.

Paggenger behaviour - most of the travellers in India  like me are obsessed to get down the plane as soon as it lands. People will get up and start taking their bags while plane is still taxiing to gate.

Since they dint heed to any safety instructions, and least conerned, it is waste for the cabin crew to tell them.",Southeast Asia,5.0,December 2015,4 September 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0

Good budget airline to tiruchy,Geetha027,Singapore - Tiruchirappalli,"I and my husband travelled  to Tiruchy in mid July 2016 by Air India Express. If I am not wrong, its the only morning flight going there and we had no choice. The flight was delayed by half and hour but was informed promptly by the Airline. What concerns me most is, it was not the first time that I have encounter delays...my previous flights were also delayed for at least minimum 30 mins. Flight delays should be taken note by management. As for the fare, superb good deal. Next the seats, I think its about time to refurbish all air india express flights. I am not expecting a comfy seat but at least a presentable one. Seats are left with the metal frames only....lol .Management please look into this. As for service, staff were excellent. Cleanliness was average, food was damn lousy. I dont mind buying a decent meal if they can provide a menu.

Terribly a flag carrier!!,Aravindhnaga,Singapore - Tiruchirappalli,"Worst flight had ever taken in my journeys. Poor maintenance, shaggy leather seats,broken arm rests,torn magazine holder,below average attendants services..

Two main ""best"" things to take note are:
- Frequent flight delays on an average of about 3-6hrs each occurrences. Nothing to be surprised if the scheduled flight is cancelled in the last minute. Still the tickets are so high rated.

- Flight announcement is very important for passengers. So it has to be in languages that they could get it clearly. Being a flag carrier from a nation with different languages flight announcements must be made in English and destination state's language where the flight is heading to. This would really makes sense for an average passenger!!

Flag carrier isn't just an airplane, It shows the nation's pride, culture, respect, services and even beyond that!!

My worst experience of my LIFE!,Nalindeepa,New Delhi - Dubai,"My family of three were travelling to Dubai for a Holiday for the first time. I saw their advertisement in the paper starting flights to Dubai and the prices were slightly better than other airlines.I also paid extra charges to get the front seats with more legroom and were very excited to Travel by our National carrier after about 15 years.
We boarded the aircraft. The air conditioning was not working. We were sweating profusely. The Air hostess tells it will be alright after the plane takes off. I have never heard in history that air-conditioning will happen after take off. we had to sweat for al most 30min. OMG I can never forget.
Secondly the attitude of the air hostess was very rude. 
Thirdly the snacks were nice, but the way they were served was very cheap.
Fourthly, air hostess came to serve water and she opened the bottle which was completely filled straight in  glass with tray and spilled the water on me!
Fifthly the tea was served straight without any plate in their hand.
Sixthly there was no extra pillow or blanket for us too!

Best Budget-Airlines I had travelled in,sitalaxmi1928,Kuala Lumpur - Chennai (Madras),"My experience with Air India Express has been good so far. I have taken the round trip with Air India Express between KL and Chennai quite often. I have not experienced delays so far and flights are usually quite smooth. 
Online booking is quite easy using a debit card and I could select my seats and insurance. The fares are more than reasonable. Now, they seem to be offering special meals for extra payment. Baggage allowance is 30 Kg from KL and 20 Kg from Chennai - I would have preferred the reverse or 30 Kg both ways!
The usual, vegetarian meal packs and water (extra bottles were provided whenever I requested) is more than adequate for me. Tea is superb and they give a second cup on request! Earlier, they used to give idli, sambar, kitchadi, etc., in the meal pack, which I prefer to the current rice menu! Free liquor is not supplied, which is an advantage as far as I am concerned, having had some bad encounters in other airlines supplying free liquor! 
The staff are very efficient, courteous, complete the meal-beverage service quite fast (usually in less than an hour) and let the passengers sleep after that. I like the traditional saree dress-code of the female stewardesses reminding me that I am on the way home!
Being a budget airline, there is usually no inflight entertainment, they have only economy class and seats are a bit closely arranged, except in the first row and the two emergency-exit rows. One can select these seats for payment during online booking.
I have also traveled to and from Muscat by Air India in Business class with my invalid mother and enjoyed the flight. My mother did too. The staff were efficient, pleasant and courteous and attentive to us.

Good for domestic travel,ArunaTravelReviews,Dehradun - Bengaluru,"Everyone blames Air India saying that Air hostess are old, aunty and all that. I personally don't feel anything.

They will be so much like machines you just don't feel like asking them anything. With air india hostesses however they look, atleast they take care of your basic needs. We wanted cotton and we told by some airlines that they don't keep cotton. Whereas with airindia they gave cotton for us for the ears. My mother has the problem of ear pain while take off and landing. No other airlines offer cotton except air india. They know what are the basic needs of the human being. They even provide food also. I have found the food to be of good quality. Overall my experience with them is always good. They even provided blankets without asking when they saw that my mother was suffering from cold. In one of the airlines I did see that they said they don't carry blankets. All said and done if there is any choice for me to travel between two airlines with cost being the same, I would choose air india any day atleast for domestic travel due to their care towards the passengers which I have not seen in any other airlines.
