"Possibly the best Indian airline I've flown to date, shame its now merged with Air India",akghosal,Kolkata (Calcutta) - New Delhi,"I flew on Vistara on October 2024 when my morning Air India flight from Kolkata to Delhi (when travelling back to London Heathrow on Air India) got cancelled due to a bird strike and so my flight got rebooked in the evening on Vistara before then taking my Air India flight to Heathrow from Delhi. And I can say that the service on board was mostly excellent and definitely the service all airlines in India should be providing to passengers. The flight was on time without any delay, the food was quite tasty and well prepared, the seats were quite comfortable, the interior looked relatively modern and well maintained, including the toilets, staff were mostly polite, helpful & friendly, and I really loved the airline Wi-Fi, which allows you to use the airline's entertainment, flight map and even some other services such as flight feedback (something which domestic airlines around the world, and even domestic Indian airlines, need to take note and learn from). 

My only minor issues with Vistara were that while the food was very good, the non vegetarian food ran out by the time the food reached my brother (who had to get a vegetarian dish) and while the seats were comfortable, at least for the short flight, the legroom still seemed a bit tight. But apart from that, I had a great time with Vistara and its a shame in my opinion that its now merged with Air India and no longer an independent airline. All I can say is that other Indian airlines should learn from Vistara and upgrade their levels of service so that it matches (or even exceeds) Vistara's and I also think that all airlines worldwide whether domestic or international should have a Wi-Fi system operated by the airline, especially the entertainment & flight map systems for domestic flights.",Domestic,4.0,October 2024,12 December 2024,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Even though we tried calling them they didn’t bother to come and collect them and I was left with no space with the kid on my lap.

So much better than Air India….,PeteD60,Goa - Bengaluru,"Flight at end of trip from GOI to BLR - had booked premium economy class seats but decided a couple of days beforehand to upgrade to business class – an indulgence but worth it.

No dedicated security line or lounge at GOI – not a problem - we sat close to the gate - boarded first - 8 seats in business class - only 3 of us - loaded efficiently - push back on time – offered orange juice and very small bottle of water - food order taken pre-take-off - A320 – 1A+C- no alcohol - Vistara world for inflight entertainment on offer

Despite only being a 50 minute there was a hot food service - ok as a hot snack with an included overly sweet dessert

This was a proper business class experience with large comfy seats with loads of legroom with dedicated cabin staff – with a separate premium economy section behind

Avoid this airline!,OnAir08497352610,Frankfurt - Mumbai,"I had a very bad experience with both my flights from Frankfurt to Mumbai and return flight.
This concerns flight UK 28 on 17.10.2024 and flight UK 27 on 27.10.2024.
My first flight got cancelled and I was notified via SMS, so I called the number stated in the SMS - leading to an expensive call to India that was shortly ended by the service agent without providing any information. I then called the German customer care number and they were not informed about the cancellation and took serveral hours to rebook my flight! I got to fly 24h later, costing me a full day of my vacation and having to rearrange all my bookings which ended up creating additional costs.
My experience on my return flight was even worse: I was not able to web check-in, the website said to check-in at the airport counter. So I got to the airport with some extra time in advance, but they told me they are unable to check me in, there is some problem with my booking because I did not board my previous flight (which was Impossible - it was cancelled!) and that I have to call the hotline. They provided a number which I called to sort it out, it was a long call, the agent understood my problem and asked to be passed to an airport agent at the counter. I went to an available counter (different employee), quickly explained and handed her the phone. They briefly talked, she tried to do the check-in and hung up on the call. It did not work, she called more agents over, did not help, called some people, did not help. Asked me to call again the hotline she hung up on to have my ticket ""unblocked"", again, on my private phone incurring costs for me. I was asked to show my boarding pass for the flight on the 18.10.2024 (that I boarded instead of the original flight) which I provided. I was asked to wait aside where they can see me. A different Vistara agent approached me and asked me to follow her, she tried to escort me out of the Mumbai airport - which I protested and asked to talk to the other agents again. The agents at the counter straight up told me they can't do anything, I can't be boarding and tried to gaslight me into thinking that not booking with Vistara directly (but via booking.com) was the problem. I told them all changes to my cancelled flight were made by the customer care team in Germany and Not booking.com, so they had me wait again. They finally figured out how to enable boarding for me, 40 minutes before my (delayed) departure time. It took over 2h to be checked in, when the waittimes at the counters was negligeble. I respectfully asked if it was possible to be upgraded as I had a horrible experience and this caused me a lot of stress, they declined telling me they don't do free upgrades and the flight is fully booked. I was not offered any sort of apology for the stress and money lost, nor any compensation. I am deeply disappointed by how this was handled by the airline and I don't think I will consider flying with Vistara again and would advise other customers to chose a different airline.",International,5.0,October 2024,30 October 2024,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0
Flight canceled just hours before departure - no reimbursement not compensation received,Laura V,Kathmandu - Paris,"Flight return back home was canceled just 6 hours before departure via sms  (text message) with no explanation and no proposed alternative.
I tried contacting customer service, and no one answers. I decide to book a flight with another company. Two weeks later, Vistara has not only NOT reimbursed the canceled flight (which they declare to do in 3-5 days on their website), but they also refuse to give any real compensation (max 100€ after insisting). In the end, I had to pay an extra 600€ to Qatar Airways to get back home.
It may seem like a good deal when booking, but as soon as there is the slightest problem, the flight will end up costing much more than more respected airline companies. Do not fall in the trap of attractive price.

"""Disappointing Experience on Vistara Flight: No Tea or Coffee for Passengers, Rude Crew Response""",Explore42751974870,Goa - Bengaluru,"Dear Vistara Management, 
@airvistara
  
Do you take tea or Coffee in the morning? Of Course, you all do.
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent experience I had on your UK581 flight at 5:30 AM. As someone who enjoys a cup of tea or coffee in the morning, I was quite surprised to find that these basic refreshments were not offered to passengers. It was even more surprising to see the cabin crew enjoying their tea or coffee, while politely informing passengers that such beverages were not available.
I understand that flights can have specific catering policies, but considering that breakfast is included in the ticket, the absence of tea or coffee seems rather disappointing. Additionally, the way this was communicated by the crew was quite unprofessional. When asked, they responded rudely, instructing passengers to simply take their seats without further explanation.
As a loyal passenger, I feel this situation does not reflect the high standards Vistara is known for. I hope you will look into this matter and ensure that such experiences are avoided in the future.
Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Given the later arrival it was hard to find someone on duty to make a claim. I contacted support and was told “ We would like to explain that baggage goes through various handling processes at the airport, many of which are beyond our direct control.” This means that they do not care what happens to your luggage and don’t claim it will be handled with normal care on their airline.

"Avoid, you may lose your money because of some arbitrary policy or the othet",Safari04200177084,Bangkok - New Delhi,"Whatever you do avoid this airline. Due to a mishap I missed the first leg of my flight but accepted that loss and booked a one way expecting to be able to catch the return since, well simply I paid for it. However without any notification the airline simply cancelled my ticket including the return leg based on some policy. The least one can expect having paid for a round trip is to be notified. Further, as early as the morning of my return trip, I received text messages regarding check in, further indicating I would be on the return flight. So in addition to a lack of notification, they also affirmatively indicated that I was to be on the return flight. However in arriving at the airport I was told my ticket had been cancelled altogether and I was left stranded in a foreign country forced to pay for a last minute fare on indigo, which I may add unlike vistara, had excellent and helpful staff.

Worst coustomer care services paid money for their mistakes,rasika t,Kathmandu - New Delhi,"I had a very disappointing experience with Vistara's customer service during my recent journey. When I called to inquire about extra baggage charges, the representative provided confusing and inaccurate information. I was told that upgrading to premium economy would increase my baggage allowance, but this was not the case. I ended up paying an additional NPR 23,000 due to their mistakes.

The customer service was frustrating; I spent two hours trying to get assistance, with long hold times and no meaningful help. It seems the agents lack proper training and knowledge.

Extremely poor customer service,Blossom F,New Delhi - London,"I recently and for the first time travelled to and from India by Air Vistara.

However, I had a complete opposite experience on the return journey (24/09/2024) where I travelled via economy class. 
Starting from the boarding, there was no system. Although they were announcing rows  and who should board when, they allowed people to board at random. The service provided by the air hostess (Preeti) was appalling. I understand the flight was very busy but I believe that is what they are trained for and paid for. There was no smile, no pleasantness in her demeanour, just a very stern, aggressive, tired look. It just felt like she was doing a favour whenever anyone asked her for something. Air hostess normally ask what we want for drink or food. She did not. It was left up to us to request something when we saw her coming with the trolley. She forgot to serve drinks to some people. 
The food was good quality and we arrived on time which was positive. But I would avoid flying with them simply because of their customer service.",International,2.0,September 2024,25 September 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Despite our repeated requests for assistance,  noone provided adequate help, leaving us feeling disrespected and ignored. Specifically the staff were very rude and ignorant,we urge each and everyone but noone helped us.

It was not expected from Vistara calling itself India’s number one airlines.

I would like to mention some name from Delhi Airport of Vistara they didn’t even take any initiative to help us especially Tarun was talking to someone and later he hide himself and came later when time is up and Payal and Aditya was talking very rudely and loudly.

But Vistara denied that their system does not show it. And denied my check in if I did not pay $100.  They said this $100 is for check in baggage charge from Bangalore to Delhi. And very much ill treated me. Ridiculous explanation and in-humane treatment.   

I also showed proof from Vistara website that Vistara honors the baggage allowance of international flight segment.   Their response was it was not showing in their system.   So, whose fault is it if the Vistara system is crappy??  Apparently I had to pay $100 per passenger (total $300 ) to get my bags checked.

"Horrible, Cheap and Shameful",sumeetgrover,New Delhi - London,"My experience on this Air Vistara flight can be summarised as follows: Horrible, Cheap and Shameful.

SEATING
I was seated at location 58J. It begs the question if this seat is fit for human seating for more than an hour. The seat was stiff, with no ability to recline, whereas the passenger in front of me had fully reclined their seat to further suffocate my seating space. This seat on your aircraft is an opportunistic attempt at making money when there is no respectable or bearable room for seating. It is like sitting on a crowded bus for 9 hours.

I spent at least half of the flight standing, something that I find totally unacceptable and horrible for the price that I paid Air Vistara. 

ENTERTAINMENT 
The entertainment screen in front of my seat was no more useful than a dummy screen for a toddler. Your crew kindly restarted the screen 3 times, yet it remained an experience of me staring at a blank screen. See photo attached.

I have never been on a long haul flight with no entertainment, and I refuse to find this acceptable.

FOOD 
The first vegetarian meal served on the flight was awful. One could not distinguish the gravy from the vegetables because it all looked like a mash. I redused to consume it.

The second vegetarian meal tasted like a cheap microwave meal that I wouldn't consume at home, let alone on a long haul flight that claims to be ""India's Finest"". I returned this meal.

CONCLUSION 
Should you regard my complaints as unreasonable, I would invite your Head of Customer Services to do the same 9h10m journey on the seat allocated to me as a mystery customer, and taste the delights of what is served, and get the experience of what a customer goes through. Of course, if their experience turns out to be better than mine, I will happily accept their report.

It is shameful that such low grade food be served on a flight from India, a country that has a rich tradition of delicious food.

Irresponsible airline to avoid ! Worst experience !,Adolphine A,Chennai (Madras) - Paris,"My feedback concerns a return journey from Chennai to Paris CDG on 19th. When checking in our THREE pieces of luggage, the staff at Chennai airport only gave us 2 luggage labels. When we asked for the third, they wrote the number 3 on a corner of the tag, explaining that this would be enough. A lack of professionalism and an abuse of the lack of knowledge of the passages to avoid spending time rectifying the action. At CDG airport terminal 2C, we waited nearly 2 hours for one of our pieces of luggage to arrive, but it never did! We had to make a complaint about the lost suitcase, and one of the airport staff told us that this was not an isolated case and that it was very common at Vistara. On the same flight, several of us passengers reported lost baggage. Luckily, the missing bag was one of the 2 labels provided, because without the label it would have been IMPOSSIBLE to claim the baggage.

Good onboard service and conscious about food allergies.

Excellent service in the París airport, the staff there was really  nice and helpful, something which is not usual in  the French  airports, unhopefully…

The only cons was the contradictory information about how to proceed during our 15 hours transit in Mumbai airport, as on the phone and during the check in Paris we were informed that the baggage was sent directly to Singapore -no need to check in in Mumbai-
 
Once in Mumbai, the local staff told us to pick up our baggage and do the check in again BUT for that we needed a VISA  to quit the transit area. Even informing them about the informations we received in Paris, they said No possible,no possible… so we need to argue with them and once we requested to talk with their boss, they respected the initial instructions..

DONT EVER BOOK VISTARA THEY ARE THE WORST!!!!,Alexis U,Male - New York City,"MOST HORRIBLE FREAKING TRAVEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE…. Not to mention my husband and I were traveling home from our honeymoon. I have come to reviews now since after 30 emails back and forth they refuse to answer or even resolve the issue. 

Complaint is as follows:

On June 10th, our original flight plans were unexpectedly altered, resulting in a re-routing that required a domestic visa within India, which we were not informed about. As a result, when we arrived to check-in for our flight on July 6th, we were denied boarding due to this requirement.

Upon seeking assistance from the manager on duty, we encountered an unsettling experience that I must bring to your attention. The manager, whose identity I would appreciate you verifying, handled the situation in a manner that was both disrespectful and unprofessional. Despite acknowledging that our flight change was beyond our control and the responsibility of Vistara Airlines, he initially seemed reluctant to assist us promptly.

After considerable delay, he eventually arranged an alternative flight for us, which regrettably did not maintain the Business Class seating we had originally booked. Despite the availability of Business Class seats, he insisted on placing us in Economy Class without providing a clear reason for this decision. Furthermore, his dismissive attitude towards my concern for comfort on a 14-hour flight was deeply disheartening.

Subsequently, our communication with Vistara Airlines via Twitter has not yielded a satisfactory resolution. It is essential to emphasize that the core issue remains unaddressed: we were not rebooked into the same level of accommodations that we initially paid for and were entitled to.

They have since lied about why we were rebooked in economy rather than business stating that seats weren’t available which is a complete lie as we were offered to upgrade to business on each of our flights for an extra cost. 

Like I stated before, I have emailed them 30 times and still no resolve, they continue to speak in circles and lie to my face about different reasons why stuff happened.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH VISTARA,Achindra C,Indore - Detroit,"We had a very bad experience with Vistara employees at the place they issue the boarding pass. First while getting the boarding pass five employees gathered around us and crowded us. Secondly if they find out you are traveling international then they want your money somehow and try getting you to pay exorbitant amounts of money through forcing you to check in your carry-on and sending it as luggage causing issues in connecting flights. They also attempted to mislead us about how much the luggage weighed and wasted times in hopes of forcing us to pay the demanded money. They were not able to give us a boarding pass all the way to our destination so we had to repeat this process over and over again.

Our experience with Vistara was TERRIBLE and if you want to avoid a headache and wasting your money then don't fly Vistara",International,1.0,August 2024,13 August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Traumatising Experience. Never to fly Vistara again,Amulya T,Mumbai - Dubai,"Absolutely horrendous experience. 

My child was unwell and had to immediately use the rest room. F&B service was on so the food cart was present. Since the child couldn't wait, I rushed him to the washroom on the other side. As we exit the washroom, the in-flight supervisor stops me and says, the washrooms for economy class are at the otherwise and I should use that next time.

I explained to her that my 7 year old is unwell and hence we rushed as the F&B service was on. She said this washroom is dedicated for higher classes as they pay more and they wouldn't want to wait because other class (economy) passengers are using and she needs to look after their comfort. I was shocked. I still went on explaining, I am a frequent traveller,  I understand but the situation was different. Other airlines do not object if there is an emergency for the child. She immediately snapped back saying, ""then you can choose to fly other airlines"". My job is to look after the comfort of business class as they pay more. I was obviously hurt. I said I cannot let the child wait as it might lead to an emergency and if she expects me to. To this she says, ""it's your child and if that's how you wish to leave him, it's your choice"".

This whole experience left a horrible impression on my 7 year old who thought he made a mistake and told me he wouls apologise. Vistara made it Absolutely clear that economy passengers comfort comes after business class. Which is debatable. They pay extra yes, but when it's an emergency with a child? Come on!

I did raise it with couple of economy class in flight service cabin crew. They were more understanding..probably trained to handle economy class passengers? The superior later came to explain, she was doing her job, and business class passengers wouldn't wait and would complain. Now, I have travelled economy,  premium economy, business all classes but have never seen passengers not understanding these things or airlines behaving this way.

Thanks Vistara for leaving  horrible impression on my child, making an economy class passenger feel helpless and unwanted over premium economy/business class, and a letting me down as a parent.

I hesitate for the few kg and after the 15min discussion I was ready. It was a harassment when he asked me to give my luggage to anyone outside as he know I can’t do that. It was all set as I handover the cash, the manager Vishal luthra came in and ask me to pay for the full luggage are 8400 or give the luggage outside the airport. I explained that his counterpart ask for 1600 and already handover the cash. I end up paying 1600 to 8400. Not sure , if he Vishal gave receipt to me or out in his pocket.

Checking service is worse and takes longer if it works. My daughter was travelling alone first time to india . while travelling  from Hyderabad to London , and at the checkpoint, their representative was unhelpful and laughed when my daughter requested assistance. They did not conduct a proper boarding check and did not include a luggage tag on her boarding pass, which she only noticed when she arrived in Delhi for immigration and boarding. They somehow hand-wrote the luggage number on the herboarding pass. When she was about to board the plane in Delhi, the gate representative informed her that she had not completed the boarding process correctly; it was not my daughter's responsibility to complete the boarding clearance or place the luggage tag on her boarding pass. 
Only there did they complete her manual boarding clearance, and she was able to board the flight to London. I was constantly in contact with my 19-year-old daughter  while she was at the Delhi airport.

Vistara to/from Dhaka ( in Business Class ) ?? NEVER AGAIN,Puhup_Verma,Dhaka City - New Delhi,"If one could set a textbook example of pathetic on-ground service by an airline , Vistara at Dhaka would be one of the top contenders.

After a harrowing arrival experience , we prayed that our departure from the city would be relatively smoother. These hopes were dashed within minutes of entering the airport complex.

First & foremost , entering ( or even approaching ) the terminal in Dhaka is a struggle in itself. It's perhaps the only airport I've seen ""touts"" ambush passengers , just to offer a speedy entry into the terminal.
While the airline is not responsible for this chaos , it sure can communicate the presence of a SEPARATE ENTRY for Business Class passengers , at the fag end of the terminal. A simple footnote on the E-ticket / Web check-in confirmation is sufficient enough.

Coming now to the worst aspect of it all : CHECK-IN.
1. The presence of dedicated desks for Business / Premium Economy passengers was just an eyewash. In other words , staff turned a blind eye towards passengers with Economy Class tickets queuing up in the Priority lanes ( and inevitably leading to vice-versa ).
2. Unfortunately , the so-called Business Class desk was being manned by the most lethargic / uninterested staff member from this lot. She intentionally prolonged the check-in process of the ( Economy Class ) passengers ahead of us , to reduce her own workload as much as possible. Please note - We WASTED 20 MINUTES in this queue , forcing us to seek alternate options.
3. When we decided to shift lanes , there was a brief lull in the check-in chaos ( due to the sudden / absurd implementation of a document check right where the queue began ). In other words - all the counters were free at that moment of time , except for the so-called Business Class one. But still , NONE of the staff members volunteered to help us out , deeply engrossed in their own chit-chat.
4. Using polite signs & gestures , I requested the man supervising the adjacent counter ( Premium Economy ) to process our formalities. But seeing a family of 4 adults , he blatantly ignored my plea and shamelessly called a random solo passenger to come forward. Nevertheless , we left the ( still busy ) Business Class queue , and lined up at the Premium Economy one.
5. But when our turn finally came , the man CLOSED THE COUNTER. No reason whatsoever. He just blurted out ""Go to the next line ( i.e. Economy )"" , and prepared to dash out. It was only when we emphatically told him that we're flying Business Class , and that we've already moved down one counter , that he stayed back.

The contract LOUNGE was mediocre , with blow average F&B options. But , quite an oasis when compared to the general condition of the terminal.

As expected , the BOARDING process was a mess. No 'Priority Boarding' being implemented , despite the presence of senior airline staff at the gate. They could visualize our colour-coded boarding passes ( golden for Business Class ) , but turned a blind eye yet again.

Last but not the least , the IN-FLIGHT EXPERIENCE. Courteous & proactive cabin crew handling the Business Class cabin , and perhaps the only saving grace for Vistara on this journey. But the food onboard ? HORRID

Won't be flying Vistara on this route in the near future.",Asia,1.0,January 2024,24 July 2024,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Pathetic on-ground experience,Puhup_Verma,New Delhi - Dhaka City,"Check-in : 
Reached the airport just 2 hours before our early-morning flight , and voilà - a CLOSED Business Class check-in desk. The staff member handling the adjacent desk ( for Premium Economy ) neither volunteered to to do our check-in , nor did she make an effort to call one of her colleagues.
Just to be clear - this wasn't a case of an innocent staff member being M.I.A. for a brief period of time. The Business Class counter wasn't operationalized AT ALL that morning , simply because the staff felt it's a waste of time.
Luckily , a senior Vistara staff member overseeing the domestic operations noticed our helpless state , and got the counter opened. The staff member who finally did our check-in was a bit miffed and slow , but overall we still managed to save a lot of time by not lining up in the regular queues.

Lounge : 
Unlike other international carriers flying out from Delhi , the check-in staff member here at Vistara gave us no information about the lounge whatsoever. Nonetheless , we made our way to the Air India Lounge ( currently closed for renovation ) , which was in shambles.

Boarding :
A bit chaotic due to additional security checks of cabin bags ( for male passengers ONLY ) done by the airline staff. The entire process could have been a bit more streamlined.

Seating / Layout : 
Standard Business Class seats in 2-2 layout , comfortable enough for the short hop to Dhaka

Service :
Courteous crew. 

Food & Beverage : 
Below average.

Arrival :
Saving the WORST for the last - it took 1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES for our bags to arrive at the luggage belt.
Here's a breakdown of the time spent after disembarking the aircraft :
1. 35 minutes at Immigration ( complete mayhem ) , during which we expected that the bags would be already there on the belt. We were so WRONG.
2. Once we reached our luggage belt , it took 40 minutes for the first batch of bags to arrive , EXCLUDING OURS. Shocking considering that the 4 of us contributed to 50% of the Business Class cabin ( 8 seats in total ) , with each bag having a so-called ""PRIORITY"" tag attached to it.
3. After another 20 minutes or so , our bags miraculously arrived in one of the subsequent batches.

This is inefficient , leave alone the multiple lines etc . 

I did all this and at counter , they had set aside my luggage and when I showed them the receipt they mentioned we will take care of luggage , which they never did and I did not get my bag in the middle of business trip.

I have been trying to call their customer care center and the number the hyderabad baggage center provided , there  has been no response or at the customer care center , they provide no information . They still cannot tell where my bag is .

Because no staff was present, I couldn't do web check-in myself. Later, they had the audacity to blame me and refused to accept any responsibility for their failures. Despite not doing web check-in, nothing was refunded. Instead, they made me wait endlessly for staff to address my concerns. If the management had any competence, I wouldn't have missed my flight despite arriving 50 minutes early. This pathetic behavior makes me question if Vistara even cares about its passengers. I would strongly urge everyone to avoid this airline and choose one where you at least get proper guidance and don't have to wait endlessly for staff to appear.

Vistara's Inconvenient Baggage Policy : Rechecking at Delhi Airport During Transit Creates Visa Hassle,LuvKha,Dhaka City - Paris,"I made a reservation on 03/05/2024 for a flight from Dhaka to Paris via Delhi with Vistara departing on 08/05/2024.

After booking, I learned that I had to check my luggage during my transfer. With a short 1 hour 35 minutes layover in Delhi, I didn't have time to collect and recheck my luggage, which also required a visa. When I contacted Vistara, they informed me they couldn't assist as it was clearly stated in the terms. While they mentioned that all flights have the same policy of sending luggage to the destination with the same PNR, I found it puzzling why Vistara couldn't do the same. They should either stop taking reservations for flights requiring separate check-ins or provide clearer warnings to customers.",International,2.0,May 2024,9 May 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

This has been the worst nightmare i had with any airlines , the agent at the counter just said no seat and he told me to go to customer service, they were as pathetic and just said seats cancelled no reason or alternative solutions, I asked them why was it not communicated to me and why this last minute cancellation as i got a alert for online check in as well. I had to book through a another airline and spend another $1300, so that i could make it on time.

A memorable flight. Kid Sized Good food. Clean cabin. World class piloting. Terrorizing landing at TIA. Competent staff.,selvakumar2015,Chennai (Madras) - Kathmandu,"Having gone through a rather harrowing time due to unexpected cancellation of UL 126 flight (MAA-CMB) of Sri Lankan Airlines, I had to quicky figure out a way to reach KTM as my travel arrangements in Nepal were already in place.
I am basically used to booking a flight through my trusted laptop.
So I had to seek the assistance of an airport ground staff to book a flight ticket to KTM   using my brand new smartphone.
The Gen Z is so smart with these modern gadgets that the ground staff  could not only crack the smart phone but also managed to block the one last available slot on Vistara Flight to KTM.
Another kind soul from Sri Lankan airlines arranged a golf buggy to transport me to Terminal 4 which is about a mile away from Terminal 2.
Terminal 4 from which both Vistara and Air India / Air India Express operate their flights was deserted with a lone coffee shop which was still open serving good coffee but stale snacks.
The counters were opened only at 4.30 am. Having fought a losing battle with an army of mosquitoes, I made a quick exit from Terminal 4.
The check-in process was smooth and the staff were courteous.
The UL 832 flight took of on time. The flight was smooth, piloting was very professional and the announcements were clear.
Having lost my sleep due to the fracas caused by cancellation of UL126 flight, I could not sleep on the flight also as both the neighbors on my side were snoring their head off in different pitches. And the guy sitting next to me also started using my shoulder as a pillow.
The inflight breakfast, though frugal was hot and tasty. 
The black coffee was of outstanding quality.

The DEL-KTM flight UK 155 was also on time. After having to wait for change of flights in the noise-pollution free IGIA airport for almost 5 hours, UK 155  also took off on time.
The flight was smooth and the food, though sufficient for only a four year old kid, was tasty.
Landing at TIA airport, Katmandu which is about 4500 ft above MSL is a different ball game altogether. As the towering Himalayas surround the Kathmandu valley, the pilot has to make a steep dive to reach the rather short runway. A round of applause and a deep sigh of relief from the passengers for reaching terra firma in one piece.

The stamp of SIA is still visible on Vistara in spite of the on-going process of merger with the Maharaja. The check-in process was fast, the staff were friendly and the piloting was world class.

Worst service and unfriendly cabin crew,Stay59089045998,Mumbai - Ahmedabad,"My family took an early morning flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad on 28.04.2024. The breakfast was not served for our entire raw (15 A-F) but given to others. We waited, and after reminding the crew twice it was served when the Flight was about to land. After serving we were asked to close the tray table. We understand that the cabin crew served the breakfast by mistake skipped the raw, but there is no justification for serving the breakfast after two reminders and that also at the fag end of the journey.
More shocking was they never felt sorry for their omission. Pure unprofessionalism and immaturity displayed by the unfriendly Cabin crew. Never expected such a treatment and unprofessionalism from TATA group.

To add more, our return journey was by Ahmedabad -Mumbai Vande Bharat Train in the same evening, which was more enjoyable and the serving crew was more professional, matured and friendly.

Worst Service Experience and Handling at Vistara Airlines Counter,Shabnam P,Hyderabad - Ottawa,"Dear Vistara Customer Service Team,

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the service experience my family and I encountered at the Vistara Airlines counter on April 17th, 2024, at Hyderabad airport. We had booked tickets from Hyderabad to Ottawa, with booking reference number LN5CXX, and despite having all the relevant documents required for entry into Canada, we faced numerous challenges and obstacles at the check-in counter.

My sister, S****** Parveen Khan Pathan, holds a Canadian visitor visa and a bridging work permit, as she is currently employed by a multinational company in Canada and has her Permanent Resident (PR) status approved. Similarly, I, T******* Khan Pathan, hold Canadian PR status and also work for a multinational company in Canada. Additionally, my mother, Z****** Khan Pathan, possesses a Canadian visitor visa and is visiting Canada to meet her grandson in Ottawa. Lastly, my brother-in-law, Mohammad Sajid, who recently married my sister, holds a Canadian visitor visa and plans to return to India within the next few months. We had meticulously prepared all the necessary documents as per the requirements of the Canadian government and immigration authorities.

Despite arriving at the Hyderabad airport well in advance, we encountered several issues at the Vistara Airlines counter, which led to a significant delay and ultimately caused us to miss our flight. These issues included:

1) Staff insisting on the necessity of a Qatar visa, despite it not being mandatory for our transit through Doha.
2) Initial assurance of boarding passes only till Munich, with instructions for self-transfer, which was later rescinded due to perceived time constraints. We had a lay over of 5hrs in Munich.
3) Demand for return tickets, contrary to the regulations of IRCC, which we had to reluctantly purchase to avoid missing our flight.
4) Unwillingness to accommodate us on alternative flights, despite the availability of tickets on Air India, citing arbitrary reasons such as the need for wheelchair assistance.
5) Prolonged delays, lack of coordination among staff members, and unprofessional behavior, including making derogatory remarks and inappropriate gestures.
The entire ordeal lasted for over six hours, during which we felt utterly disregarded and humiliated by the conduct of the Vistara Airlines staff, including Mr. Majed, Mr. Shiva, Mr. Satyajit, Mr. Shubham, and Ms. Abiba, who purportedly held managerial authority.
Ms,Abiba,also made gestures to other staff,not to help my mom, an elderly lady, Got her Blood pressure shoot-up waiting at the counters for more than 7hours  just to get a boarding pass with all the required documents
6) Mr. Shiva expresses no concern regarding the company's loss if we cancel the tickets, as he firmly believes that his personal finances remain unaffected regardless of whether the company benefits or suffers.
7)Mr. Majed and Mr. Satyajit appeared lethargic, feigning assistance by suggesting booking tickets with other airlines, yet their actions were limited to idle chatter between themselves, offering no substantial help.

I'm curious whether the company finds value in retaining staff members who exhibit indifference towards the company's financial losses.

I just wonder, aren't they in service industry? Is it justified to make a sign or inappropriate gestures before passengers? How professional is this behaviour? Are the passengers travelling for free?? or is it because they don't have any other option or ?? Why the passengers have to beg for their Boarding???
Isn't it the responsibility of the airlines to check their staffs attitude and behaviour and their knowledge levels.
Who will take the responsibility for the mental harassment and humiliation that we have faced at the Hyderabad Airport Vistara Airlines counter?
This experience not only caused us immense mental distress and inconvenience but also resulted in substantial financial losses, as we had to purchase additional tickets and incurred extra expense of Rs 32,179 per passenger as we had to book last minute tickets due to inefficiency of the Vistara Airlines Staff. We ourselves booked tickets with AirIndia airlines and our experience with Air India was smooth and efficient as they did not ask for any irrelevant documents. Consistency and clarity in the boarding process contribute significantly to customer satisfaction. If vistara airlines could emulate such practices, it would likely enhance the overall experience for passengers.  
 
I urge Vistara Airlines to conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and take appropriate actions to rectify the deficiencies in staff training, customer service, and adherence to regulatory requirements. Furthermore, I request compensation for the financial losses incurred and an apology for the distress caused by the negligent and unprofessional behavior of your staff.

I trust that you will address this matter promptly and provide a satisfactory resolution.",International,1.0,April 2024,21 April 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Vistara service gone down lavatory !! Unforgivable and absolutely terrible experience!,Daydream63965505142,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Here’s to Flying the ‘New Feeling’ and then taking a strong pain killer to get rid of it! 

These days The pricey VISTARA ticket-fare not only includes a worn-out greeting and pretentious smile but also a complete lack of care and understanding for their loyal customers. 

As a frequent flyer of this airline,  I’m clearly upset and here’s why..

I’ve Been suffering from severe back pain and when I received a broken seat, and requested to be shifted to another seat, I was told that there are no other seats available. Since I was genuinely uncomfortable I walked around the aircraft to check if any other seats available . I saw multiple empty seats in the premium economy and requested to move there given the pain and discomfort the broken seat in economy was giving me… I was refused by cabin crew and then even after sincerely requesting the inflight supervisor ( Ms. and sharing the level of discomfort and pain I was being caused… my request was rejected. While constantly slipping off my seat, When I checked under it , I found that it was absolutely filthy with wafers, other crumbs and even bugs. 

Absolutely shocked at the level of professionalism and hospitality at Vistara. This used to be my favourite airline but just so put off by this behaviour. Gone are the days of actually caring to or just trying to make your customer comfortable and happy.

Awesome airline! Food portions can be improved on 3+ hours domestic routes,Ph0512,London - New Delhi,"I've been a consistent traveller onboard Vistara both domestically (Hyderabad-Delhi/Kochi-Delhi) and internationally (London/Bangkok-Delhi) over the past 2 years. They definitely stand out in front of the others in the Indian aviation market. Crew is very kind & sweet, the food tastes great. On the London flight — they offered a lot of drinks and food to the passengers. The crew on this London flight was fantastic. They were always available for the passengers and listened to every single request that we made even though it's a long flight. They kept checking through the aisles to see if any passenger requires anything. The cabin was mostly clean. The TV worked fine. Their baggage allowance is great! 10/10 points for that. On-time performance is mostly alright. Sometimes they depart with a delay but reach on-time, somehow. 
Just one complaint: their food portions have gone down significantly in 2023. This is a disappointing aspect. For example: the flight to Kochi from Delhi was 3 hours long and the portion size was too little. I felt very hungry afterwards. On domestic routes - improvement can be done on some aspects. On international - I feel they're doing great & should keep it up.

Economy to Economy since aircraft was overbooked. In this day and age of computers, I was surprised to learn that Vistara staff still use fingers and toes to count available seats!! Anyway, no apology was given at any stage!!  
 
Was also told that I'd be seated in an exit row but must be available to assist cabin crew in case of an emergency. Of course, that meant no relaxing during the flight! Although, given the deplorable standard of the meal served on board, I was unable to really relax anyway, waiting and wondering if I'd need to go to the toilet before the flight landed!

To make matters worse, although the check in person said I would be provided compensation for their stuff up, Vistara's so-called customer service dept didn't want to discuss matters, saying only that I should enter details on the Vistara website to claim compensation.  

And of course, given Vistara's inability to use computers, I wasn't surprised to learn that their website's form also does not work, so my only option now is to contact my credit card company and try to claim that way.

Next time, I'll stick to flying with Singapore Airlines instead of this third-class airline.  I suppose it will be easy for them to merge with Air India since the service standards etc will remain the same, they just have to change the name on the aircraft!",Southeast Asia,1.0,March 2024,9 April 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Horrific experience,Voyage06564164544,Bengaluru - Kochi (Cochin),"I went for my mother’s funeral.

On return, I came to the gates at 6pm on April 1, 2024 for the 7:30pm flight UK505. It’s April 2, 2024 and I’m still at the airport to board another flight as I’ve never seen such an irresponsible set of staffs.

It was a day when many Vistara flights were delayed or either cancelled.

When they were not onboarding even after 7pm, when we asked the officer at the gate, he informed that the flight is delayed and will take off by 11:30pm. Till we asked, no updates were given by the Vistara staffs. The flight status was showing “on time” and “security” even at 8pm.

The flight arranged dinner for us and by 11:50pm, we were on-boarded to the flight. But the flight didn’t take off even at 12:30am on April 2, 2024.

When checked with the cabin crew, they informed that the captain of the flight parked the flight and went away. Now only first officer is available. And they are waiting for another captain to come and take the flight.

The cabin crew also has been waiting since 6pm on April 1, 2024.

Then the first officer (very helpful and gentle man) informed us that by 1:15am he will inform us the decision of the flight is going or getting cancelled.

By 1:30am we were informed the flight is rescheduled to 5am. When we asked for confirmation that f the flight, they said they cannot confirm until 4am. Only then they can know if any captain can come and fly the plane to Kochi.

So they de-boarded us from the plane and we were sent to the arrival area to reclaim our baggage. In the flight we were informed if we need a refund, it will be done at the arrival. When we reached the arrival, we came to know that no such information is given to the arrival. So we strongly asked for a cancellation and confirmation on f refund. They were not willing to give the confirmation. I said I need the confirmation of refund. Finally the staff at the arrival got a WhatsApp message of my PNR full refund confirmation.

I booked another Indigo flight to Kochi at 10:10am and I’m at the airport since yesterday 6pm.

Just now while typing this message, I got a call from Vistara that the flight which was supposed to leave at 5am did not go yet and now they are ready to fly to Kochi. I asked what was the purpose of the call? They informed me the flight is only left with 6 passengers (it was almost a full flight) and if we are willing, they are ready to take us.

I said no.

Had they properly updated all passengers from time to time, they could have avoided this issue and such a hat-redness towards this airlines.

Bad Crew Behavior,Road25725153604,Bengaluru - Chandigarh,"We were super excited to travel in Vistara airlines but unfortunately the journey left a bitter taste in my mouth. I will narrate the situation without exaggeration. We didn’t have to wait in lines as we had a toddler and everything was going rather smooth. My daughter who is a toddler still breastfeeds. Nothing wrong in it, but I have to carry her on my lap and still we pay for her seat since she turned 2 as per the rules. So she was fast asleep as soon as we sat on our seats, still breastfeeding. As it was an early morning flight. The crew members started with the procedure and one of them noticed that my daughter is still on my lap. She brings an extra buckle for the safety purpose of my child during takeoff, which is totally understandable. Though it was a first time we were asked to do that. The problem arose when she failed to explain and got impatient. She then asked me if anything happens will i take full responsibility. I solemnly agreed. After a while another crew member comes and asks me to put my daughter in her seat while she is still asleep. Her attitude changed she started commanding rather than asking politely. All this while I wasn’t unwilling to do what they asked. It was a sheer failure on their end as they failed to explain. This second one comes again doesn’t help but acts rude and goes. Now it’s time for takeoff and all 3 crew members come 2 females from earlier and one male. All ambushed me and the second one and the guy were so rude and started accusing me for the flights delay. They said flight will not takeoff you have to fasten the seatbelt. The guy especially was angry and was extremely impolite, I kept saying please explain it to me. Then they very rudely asked me to unfasten my belt and put it over my daughter. I obliged and then the first one interrupts and asks them to stop forcing me. I was obviously furious, I said if it wasn’t an issue why did you bother me. They left and after a while the first one comes and kind of apologises without a sorry for the misunderstanding. Others didn’t even bother to make an effort. I wasn’t some drunk guy who was being difficult. I was a mother of a toddler whose safety is my top most priority. They had some sort of miscommunication about my situation. All through the flight I noticed that they were all newbies. It was a failure on their part but somehow I was the who was humiliated and had by far the worst journey as a new mom. Please train your crew members well.

I booked and paid non refundable ticket. I reconfirmed with Maldives immigration team about the statement given by senior Vistara member about tourist travel rule but it was denied by the Maldives immigration team and confirmed that my wife could travel on tourist visa with statements from my employer that was given to Vistara team.

While in Sri Lanka, they ignored all the emails sent asking about the luggage. The phone line is impossible to call.

On the way back from Colombo to Munich, one of the three backpacks was not delivered again. Fortunately, they brought it home to us after a few days. However, the original baggage checked in on the way there remains lost.

The airline does not respond at all to emails sent requesting compensation. Finally, they wrote yesterday:

Flight scheduled time of departure was 20:40 but flew at 01:00 hours on next day. Passengers were not contacted to take care of any food or snacks or a place to take rest while waiting as per DGCA directives for delayed flights. 
To make the matters worse, there was no coordination of the airline with ground staff. The plane had to wait for more than an hour after landing at Delhi well past midnight waiting for parking bay. Many passengers missed connecting flights while the rest spent entire night waiting without any sleep and proper meals. 

I do not think the top brass at Vistara is at all concerned about all this.

Dated cramped airline,Jai S,Mumbai - London,"One of the most noticeable drawbacks of my Vistara experience was the lack of space. The seating arrangement felt cramped, with limited legroom that made it difficult to find a comfortable position, especially during long-haul flights. This lack of space significantly detracted from the overall comfort of the journey, leaving passengers feeling constrained and restless.

Adding to the discomfort was the absence of charging outlets. In an age where connectivity is paramount, the inability to charge electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops during the flight was a significant inconvenience. With no means to power our devices, passengers were left with dwindling battery levels, unable to work, watch movies, or stay connected with loved ones throughout the journey.

Furthermore, the entertainment screens onboard appeared outdated and poorly maintained. The display quality was subpar, with pixelation and flickering making it challenging to enjoy the available content. Coupled with limited entertainment options, including a lack of recent movies or TV shows, the overall in-flight entertainment experience fell short of expectations.

Despite these shortcomings, it's worth noting that the cabin crew maintained their professionalism and provided excellent service throughout the flight.",International,2.0,March 2024,5 March 2024,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0
Never fly again with Vistara,Piotr C,Mumbai - Frankfurt,"Only negative experience with flights with Vistara. Indian staff in Mumbai the worst between all airlines which I used.

1.	Our flight was from Frankfurt by Mumbai to Colombo (and return). In way to Mumbai connection was relatively short (3h) and Vistara staff informed us that I don’t need to go to immigration (stay in transit) and is not necessary start execution of my Visa promise (ETA) which was valid to day of arrive to Mumbai.
2.	After 2 weeks when we returned immigration office didn’t allowed us to leave the airport (connection was long – above 24 hours and Vistara not  secured transit hotel). When Vistara staff was called from Imigration to offer service for customers (we were not only one Passengers form Vistara with this same problem) staff of Vistara wanted to send us again to transit are promised us to arrange transit hotel, to organize meal, water etc. But procedure which used was clever, every 100-200 meters they sent us to another person, and last one – before secure control promised that up stairs will wait another Vistara representative who will help us….. Upstairs was duty free area without any Vistara office/ desk. Without also possibility to return....
3.	We were left in the lurch and we lost our hotel reservation in Mumbai – without any Vistara help, without any compensation. Only with negative experience with the worst, lying staff of airlines which we met in our live (and we travel quite a lot – more than 10 flights yearly)

Conclusion: if are any problems not expect help and support from Vistara staff – one thing you can count on is deception and lies. In attachment you can see pictures of Vistara staff – unfortunately nobody from their wanted to show names or identificators. 

4.	And at the end: our luggage didn’t arrive from Mumbai and we got it only thanks  Lufthansa support after 10 days.

5.	Additional comment from experience with Vistara: The meal on board in economy class maybe in teste is not bad but visually resembles vomiting, what not encourage eating….

Our recommendation is: not use Vistara, is a high-risk, negative experience and losing money, stress, nerves….. Don’t suggest also that Vistara has good shareholders – it not influenced for quality of Vistara services.

- We requested separate seat for toddler, it was agreed at the checkin but did not happened in aircraft though they had many seats empty! After 10 hrs at airport we had to manage kid on our lap for next 6 hrs journey. Not sure what was costing them here? 
- They did not carry choclates, small juice packs for kids. If you know you have kids in plane then why can't we carry these basic things? 
- Any seat upgrades for seniors - may be i am expecting too much!

Lost baggage/rude customer experience,Connector48753706967,New Delhi - Amritsar,"PNR number:- 3IZ9A4
I am writing to provide feedback on 26/02/2024, regarding my recent experience with your airline, specifically concerning lost baggage during my flight and the rude treatment I encountered from both customer service representatives and airport staff.

On 17 February,2024 from Delhi to Amritsar, flight number UK 693 , I had the unfortunate experience of discovering that my baggage did not arrive at the destination along with my flight. This was particularly distressing as it contained essential items for my trip. Despite the inconvenience, I remained patient and approached the customer service desk to report the issue.

Regrettably, the manner in which I was attended to by your customer service representatives was not only unhelpful but also displayed a lack of empathy and professionalism. The dismissive attitude and lack of urgency in addressing my concerns only compounded my frustration. ""Someone of them hanging up calls on me. Telling me that they can't transfer my call to supervisor, which they transferred in the end. Moreover, Everyone was giving the time frame of 4 hours for supervisor call which I haven't received."" They told me from Delhi airport Bag was loaded and Amritsar airport said we hadn't received  it"". ""I just wanna ask them Did it fell off somewhere in the way during flying Plane. They don't have any proper time to deal with customer's issue, As of now every time I waited almost 1 hour to talk with supervisor.""

Furthermore, upon interacting with airport staff regarding the status of my baggage, I was met with rudeness and disrespect. It was disheartening to receive such treatment, especially during a situation where I was already feeling vulnerable and inconvenienced. ""They hadn't provide me with any kind of reference no. or PIR Number"". They told me ""fill the form and leave from here we can't do anything in this""",Domestic,1.0,February 2024,26 February 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Kathmandu baggage attendant and drinks during flight,arjun b,Paris - Kathmandu,"Travelled from Vistara for the 1st time , generally fight was good and comfortable but few things was strange . Travelled from Paris to ktm and back . I was suprised when travelling from Paris to Delhi it was around 9 hours of flight and the air hostesses only came twice to serve you drinks (water )  , usually when I travel in other airlines the air hostesses came to serve drinks in every 1 hour just to make sure to keep all passengers hydrated.  I was very surprised that I had to go eveytime to find them to drink a water . And it was not only me , i saw many passengers they had to find them to drink water. That’s is not very good , people gets thirsty when they travel in long flight ,. They should have come to serve drinks like other airlines do. 

I think they really should improve on this. I will never choose Vistara again if this happens to me on my next flight. 

And one more thing ,.when returning back from ktm to Paris , I went to check in my baggage . The baggage attendant of Vistara in Kathmandu were terrible , they don’t know how to smile .

Worst Experience and Never Flying Again,Sai,Bengaluru - Hyderabad,"The same review was left by others as well. They have a pathetic customer service and the company responding to the negative reviews by asking us to email the custrelations, which I did and even they dont help. God forbid if your previous international flight is delayed or you have not reached the desk on time due to some unforeseen circumstances the airlines staff does bare minimum to accommodate you. They simply ask you to get on the next flight by asking you to pay the full amount for which they are very happy to extend their service. I had a similar issue while I was flying with Air India, they were more than happy to help me find the next available flight and checked in my bags free of cost. I got delayed by 5 mins and Vistara refused to put me on the next flight and asked me to pay 14,000 to travel from bengaluru to hyderabad. I was asked to go from one staff member to other all of whom were pretty rude and none of them were helpful and suggested that the only way out was you reach the airport early and  or you book the next flight for almost double the price.

AVOID VISTARA...EVEN IF FREE,ndka,Mumbai - London,"ON 18th February leaving Mumbai to London 2.45 pm flight ....after waiting for 2 hours we were told flight cancelled. we have a choice of getting refund or wait in the airport for 24 hours and get on next flight next day. No hotel will be provided. Then 2.5 hours later we were told to check in quickly and flight will be delayed but to check in., food on flight was awful as was going to Mumbai as well. I had food poisoning and took over 5 days to recover. Wine was served in plastic cups and only 2 mouthful given...it was the worse wine and food i have ever experienced! curry and curry...oily and stale!

Verbally and Physically abused on the flight. No help from Vistara,Nirali P,London - Mumbai,"Where do I start- Woke up to the app telling me the flight was cancelled. Tried calling Vistara but offices are closed on weekend, tried to tweet them, dm on Instagram, email but no one replied. It just so happened the flight was not cancelled but infact it was delayed. Which is fine. 

Turn up to the airport at the normal check-in time and it is CHAOS and no staff there to guide or assist. All other international airlines also have separate priority queues for those traveling with children etc but not Vistara. They are far from family friendly. The entire check-in process reminded me of travelling to India back in the days when I was around 5 years old. Just utter chaos, no organisation, no staff available to assist. 

Finally make it through security and flight is delayed over an hour, spoke to someone with regards to food vouchers etc- Food vouchers/Compensation not available 

Boarding- again utterly chaotic- They announced elderly, wheelchair users etc and everyone RUNS to the gate to board blocking the way for those who genuinely need the priority boarding like the elderly/wheelchair users. And Vistara ground staff do absolutely NOTHING to stop that from happening and let everyone else board without following their own rules with the boarding process 

Flight- Awful. Not only did we depart nearly 2 hours after the scheduled departure but they ran out of vegeterian food- even though I had preordered vegeterian food, the air hostess just said ""sorry, we have no veg option left, only non veg"" To which I told her. I preordered veg as I am veg, surely you should give the veg food to those who preordered it to begin with before handing it out to everyone else who has a choice?

No usual drinks service etc- just a half cup with your meal and that's it- Could possibly be due to it being a red eye flight and departing so late- they just wanted to get the meals sorted and turn of the lights to allow passengers to sleep? Regardless, found it strange how drinks trolley was not available during the flight 

Call bell- pretty useless feature as no one comes when you call a flight attnedant- I was travelling alone with my child so I didn't want to leave him alone looking for an attendant due to the abusive passengers behind me 

I had an altercation with two male passengers sitting behind me. Firstly I tried to recline my sons seat and the passenger sat behind him pushed the chair back and started laughing at me, again I reclined his seat and he started muttering under his breath. I then went to recline my seat and the man behind me started pushing my seat aggressively, called me a ""f****ng b***ch and started shouting at me telling me not to recline my seat. I politely explained I am allowed to recline my seat and if he has an issue he needs to speak to the airhostess. I will not be moving my seat back. The man started getting really angry, shouting and being verbally abusive and physically shaking my chair- No air steward came to diffuse the situation, other passengers were just staring, recording the altercation on their phone and eventually as it seemed things were escalating another passenger took it upon themself to try and diffuse the situation but NO AIR STEWARD TO BE SEEN even though some other passengers did even press the call bell. I spent the remaining 8 hours of the flight having to endure this awful two men constantly shake our chairs, kick them and repeatedly call me a ""b***ch* etc all because I tried to recline my seat. 

Absoultely horrific experience and I would NOT book Vistara again. I have reported this to the police and I will be pressing charges against them and also Vistara for their lack of support",International,1.0,February 2024,20 February 2024,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

We had exceeded our check in baggages by mere 2kgs and he asked us for additional money. When I tried to negotiate, he included the cabin baggages as well and made the excess of baggage to 8kgs. I explained that it is my return flight and just 4 days ago I travelled with the exact same baggage from Delhi to Indore. He basically replied that he doesn't know what the other desk agent did so I called his supervisor who was utterly unprofessional and rude - ""Pyali Paul"". This lady should be fired. She doesn't belong to hospitality sector. She explained the same thing but rudely. Onward came Adhunik Kumar who was polite but said the same thing. At the end I got charged 3k additional fare for excess baggage. Had I known that my luggage would be weighed as strictly as gold, I'd have went to a Gold shop before coming to the Airport.

Discrimination towards passengers with kids,Singh,London - Amritsar,"To begin with, I made a booking via Booking.com in October to make sure everything will go smoothly because I was travelling with my wife and one year son for first time. It was our first time with our child so we wanted to make sure we got everything right. I immediately called Vistara customer service in UK after booking my flight to secure the seats in front row that we have some space for our child and we can get a bassinet. I was told that front row seats are blocked by head office and they do not issue to anyone and we need to go to the airport very early and request if we can get the seats. I still tried in January to find out if we can get seats. I was told the same thing. I was frustrated and I asked to have the seats together and I paid for the seats to be together. 

When we were flying from London Heathrow to Delhi, there was huge delay due to weather and air space taken over by Indian air force not sure if it is true. Our aircraft was taken to Amritsar and we sat inside the plane waiting to return to Delhi. After two hours, we flew back to Delhi. By this time our connecting flight to Amritsar was already departed. Upon contacting ground staff of Vistara, the manager rudely responded that there is no flight even tomorrow and we should take Indo Canadian bus to Amritsar with our own expense and he told me Vistara will refund for this flight. There was no apology for this inconvenience which was not our fault. 
I was really tired and frustrated. I had to stay in Hotel spending 5000INR for a night and further 10000INR for a taxi to my place in Punjab. It is all because of mismanagement by Vistara. I found out later that there were flights everyday and we could have travelled next day but your staff were not bothered to help. 

Anyways, I wanted to make sure my return flight is ok and wanted to know if we can get front seats. I called customer service and I asked about the seats. The lady on the phone, told me that those seats are already booked for people with the kids. I asked for middle isle seats but the lady told me that Vistara do not allow any other seats than window seats because they do not want their other customer to feel discomfort due to babies. This was really outrageous and it is a discrimination towards the passengers with kids. 

During the flight, the staff were not helpful at all. I went to the pantry to get some hot water for baby's milk and both of the crew rolled their eyes and were really unhappy because I bothered them. I did not want to make a fuss and create a scene at that time because I was with family. We spoke with other families with kids and they were told similar things. 

I have been travelling via air since 2009 and I never had this kind of experience. I am very upset with this experience and i wish i could get over with this because i really had hard time with my kid because of vistara staff behaviour.",International,1.0,January 2024,13 February 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Worst experience ever,Anna T,Stockholm - Colombo,"Everything was good until I landed in my final destination — Colombo — and discovered that my luggage didn't arrive with me. 

It took Vistara almost THREE WEEKS to finally find my luggage and deliver it to me. 

My whole trip to Sri Lanka was ruined because I was very worried about my luggage, didn't have certain medical drugs that were in my backpack and spent ages texting the airline, calling them, and trying to make them do something. I even had to change my return ticket from Sri Lanka because it made no sense for me to go to my next destination without the gear that was in my luggage. 

THREE WEEKS. It's unacceptable. And only to find out that all this time my backpack was stored in the Mumbai customs. 

However, when my luggage was finally delivered, I discovered that the horrible experience of flying with Vistara was not ended because certain items were STOLEN from my luggage, such as perfumes, coffee, and a razor (why???). Also, someone broke a box with salt but probably decided to leave it in the backpack. 

Seriously, this is too much. 

Vistara didn't offer any sort of compensation for the clothes and essentials I had to buy because I travelled from Stockholm to the tropics and was left without my luggage for three weeks.

Don’t fly w Vistara,AC,New Delhi - Varanasi,Absolutely the worst customer experience ever. I was told first of all to book a flight from my phone instead of with the snotty woman at the airline counter. The mobile view was not paginating properly and so rather than stating that I had 50kg of baggage I ended up paying for an excess of 50kg in baggage for 50000 Rupees and I sought a refund after being told by staff in person they couldn’t help me. I made no less than 10 calls to customer service and said I’d receive a return call and NEVER did. At which time I sent an email wherein I was told I’d get a response within 24-36 hours. That never happened and always required my follow up with them. I got the worst runaround garbage responses to which they finally responded after 25+ emails back and forth that excess baggage paid on my phone is non-refundable. They could’ve saved me hours of my life by saying that in the beginning and if that snotty county clerk would’ve helped me from the beginning this never would’ve happened.,Domestic,1.0,January 2024,29 January 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
WORST AIRLINES,Roam53437616842,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"Today a very upsetting incident happened where flight boarding was denied saying gate closed by Vistara - TATA SIA Airlines Ltd. 

I checked the time and I reached by 5:50 PM and flight timing was at 6:30 PM to fly and boarding 5 minutes still left and I could see other passengers was still getting into plane in que though the gate was closed before time. The lady at the gate rudely said ""no its time up, cant allow boarding"" and she just stood their doing something on computer, kept saying no and said can only accommodate in next flight for additional fee. This was so painful that despite there was time they would deny. And then had to pay 5000 bucks additional for next accommodated flight. Then they try to upsell saying sorry cant exchange ticket since only premium seats are available. Guess what, the boarding time for next accommodated flight was 11:25 PM but they started at 8:30PM. Rules are as per convenience ? How frustrating that I  cant do anything about it and have to move on with daily routine. Is it ok that airlines would delay flights any day randomly for 15min, 30 min or upto 2 hrs for free, no penalties paid to customer for losing time and money and if its above 2 hrs delay then you are eligible only for full refund. What about our schedules missed, what about cost of flight booking for next immediate flight. I had an International Flight to catch but they fooled up making all mess at airport. Think of someone who is running with low budget or no money, would be made to stay back at airport ? what if i didn't had 5000 Rs to pay for next flight? What if my card or upi didnt work, what if it was our parents who have no clue?

Worst Check-in experience,Wamika K,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Mumbai,After a long gap I took vistara air lines to travel back from Kolkata to Mumbai. I selected vistara as I would be getting a good service. To my complete shock I had a pathetic experience while luggage check in at the airport. The Kolkata ground staff spoke with me very rudely then asked me to go aside and speak with the manager. The manager didn’t bother to come for discussing the issue. Then after standing for 10mins I had to ask someone who is the manager. After I got to know who is The manager was also raising his voice. They treated me as if excess luggage is a crime and they are penalising me for the same. The staff even ensured I have to pay extra luggage for my food bag. The manager is saying record this incident as they know that this has happened multiple times and to prove themselves safe they have to put on record. Their service is extremely unfriendly for solo traveller and I chose not to travel with this airlines again.

WORST EXPERIENCE,Escape44578942857,Ahmedabad - Mumbai,"Flown many International flights including Vistaras partner Singapore Airlines but never experienced such TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
Our flight was at 8.25 to Mumbai from Ahmedabad.
We were issued with our boarding pass at 7.40 at the counter. The extra long queue made us reach the gate at exactly 8.10 15 min before boarding gates close.
The staff at the gate was extremely unfriendly and was not ready to cooperate. He only said gates are closed and no boarding is allowed. We pleaded since it was only 5 min but he was EXTREMELY RUDE. His name was Kishore Singh and he claimed to be a manager there when we asked to speak to high authority when in reality he was only a supervisor. He walked off without helping us. They were not ready to accommodate us on their next flight too nor provide a refund.
To add onto the horrible experience other staff members at their counter especially Jay Joshi showed us an attitude and they all stood there laughing at us.
Totally unacceptable and horrible airline staff.
Being an Australian customer service is number 1 to us.
International airline law allows for name call out as well as staff looking for passengers during time of boarding incase passengers dont board. None was done by VISTARA. SHAME ON VISTARA FOR HIRING SUCH STAFF WITH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

Unresolved Baggage Delay for the last 23 days.,Annasaheb Magdum,Mumbai - Frankfurt,"Unresolved Baggage Delay for the last 24 days: A Tale of Frustration with VISTARA Airways.

THIS IS WORST EVER EXPERIENCE WITH VISTARA AIRWAYS.

I am sharing a frustrating saga  of delayed baggage with VISTARA Airways. On January 2nd, I arrived at Frankfurt Airport (FRA), and eagerly wanted to return to my home and relax. Little did I know that the next 24 days would become a harrowing experience of unanswered calls, unfulfilled promises, and two missing bags.

I have diligently followed the recommended procedures to resolve this matter:
1. I have filed a property missing report at the FRA airport.
2. I reported the missing baggage through VISTARA customer care complaint system.
3. Contacted VISTARA customer care team in INDIA via telephone few times. Each time it took 40-45 minutes of international calling.
4. The customer care number from Germany has never picked up by customer relation team.
5. Messaged on VISTARA Instgram account.
6. Sales team from VISTARA Germany refused to support me on this case and asked to call to Indian customer care number.

Despite my efforts, I have received answer to ""wait for more time"" each time I have communicated with VISTARA customer relations department.

This extended delay has caused considerable inconvenience and frustration. Beyond the obvious inconvenience of not having my belongings, I have incurred additional expenses due to the necessity of purchasing essential items during this period.

The lack of resolution and communication has deeply disappointed me. The purpose of this blog is not only to express my dissatisfaction but also to request urgent action to locate and deliver my missing baggage.

VISTARA Customer relation team is giving useless and hopeless impression each time when they answer. They do not answer other than WAIT FOR MORE TIME.

Considering the prolonged delay and the impact on my travel experience, I believe it is fair to request compensation for the additional expenses and the inconvenience caused since last 23 days. I trust that VISTARA Airways values customer satisfaction and will take prompt action to resolve this matter to my satisfaction.

I would appreciate a thorough investigation into this issue and a timely response outlining the steps being taken to locate and deliver my missing bags. I look forward to a swift and satisfactory resolution.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I anticipate your prompt response and assistance in resolving this situation.

I am making it clear that my intention is not to smear the airline's reputation but to bring attention to the urgent need for resolution and compensation.

VISTARA Customer relation team is UNSUPPORTIVE. They do not answer other than WAIT FOR MORE TIME.

Thank you for reading this post.

Worst ever refund process experience,Legend F,Frankfurt - Mumbai,"First time I ever book an international flight with Indian airline company (I'm flying across globe since 12years). That was a mistake indeed!
Initially flight got cancelled by airline and i just accepted next day booking without any bargain. Later I had to cancel due to family circumstancess and since then my refund is stuck. Vistara is saying they refunded to my TA (booking.Com) and my TA saying they haven't. Finally, Vistara today accepted that they haven't processed it !!!!! all this took hell of follow-up e-mails, calls and so far no result.

Customer service,Joanne E,New Delhi - Goa,Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will begin with check in. Massive queues. We then had to pay extra baggage which was over by 2kg each. We could have transferred some items into hand luggage however did not want to hold the already frustrated customers. Was then sent to another queue to pay. Cashier was slow and I had to ask her to return my credit card due to her taking it from my sight for several minutes. The flight was delayed by 1hr. Cabin crew staff awful. No manners what so ever. They are miserable. When being served the food it is been thrown at you and snatched back. I was scared to move from my seat. The pilot announced that we would be landing in 6 minutes which came and went. He then announced 25 minutes before landing. I needed the restroom for my own personal emergency. The airhostess was screaming at me to sit down which I refused and tried to explain my own personal emergency. She then opened the restroom and said you had 30 seconds. She then continued to bang on the door. Half of the customers on the plane could hear her which was extremely embarrassing. The restroom was unkept with toilet paper overflowing.

Worst Worst Worst!!!,Guide52344502310,London - Mumbai,"This is in reference to the flight booking I’ve made through booking.com. It has been a nightmare to get a date change which I am trying since last 3 days. I have made several calls  to get my date change and everytime getting the same response from “Go To Gate” - Booking.com's partner that their system is down or their back office has the request  and they shall call me back. 

Three days ago when I called them to change the booking they quoted me the price of £350 ( quoted by Manuel) to which I did not have authority and had to take the authorisation from my company, so I declined for the moment, meanwhile I tried to get the authorisation. I called them back within 2 hours to get the date change at the same rate to which they kept responding they are not getting fares from airlines  and someone from back office support will call you.

I tried calling the next day but they kept mentioning their is a technical error and airlines is still not responding to their request. I kept calling the whole day talking to different agents and one of them (Mayur) gave me the fare difference of £590. I asked him to please speak to Manuel as he was the one holding the fare for me. I still kept calling and they had no solution for me.

Yesterday morning when I called them, they quoted a price of £1100, which is exorbitant. I was suggested by previous rep that they can release the booking from their end so airlines will have the authority to make changes. They asked me to call Vistara and check OSI remarks that the booking has been released from booking.com and now Vistara can make changes to it.

I, at the moment, am feeling helpless, annoyed and cheated. I booked business class thinking I will get better customer services and better response from both booking.com and Vistara. I do not want to be a part of who can handle the booking, I think Vistara should choose their partners wisely, customers and specially business class customers should not suffer because of the differences between Vistara and their partners and their incompetence. 

To make things difficult - Vistara is blaming boking.com and booking.com is passing the blame back to Vistara. Without even thinking what the customer wants. I am stuck in catfight between two companies.",International,1.0,January 2024,25 January 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

We checked out of our hotel only to incur 2 more days of hotel bills , uber, food , etc. Staff carrying on conversations in native language not even updating us on anything as we only understood English. A horrible end to a 2 month stay in this beautiful country and people. What a poor reflection. I would certainly not recommend my family and friends from the u,s.

Meanwhile, Indigo allowed me the second bag provided I have an international ticket following or before the domestic leg for a flat fee of 3000INR.

Vistara flight delay,Vishnu P,Goa - Mumbai,"I had an extremely unpleasant encounter with Vistara airline. My flight, UK842 from Goa Dabolim to Mumbai CST, was originally scheduled to depart at 13.20 but was significantly delayed. Vistara continuously extended the departure time on an hourly basis, causing frustration and inconvenience. Eventually, I received a message from Vistara stating that the expected departure time was now 21.00. While I understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to delays, it was disappointing that after obtaining clearance, Vistara decided to schedule a flight to Delhi instead of Mumbai, leaving all the Mumbai-bound passengers in a difficult situation. The airline's excuse of the crew not being available seemed feeble and lacking in proper planning. As a customer, this experience has been the most dreadful for me and my family. We are currently enduring the inconvenience at Dabolim airport due to Vistara airlines' lack of a backup plan. After several circumstances, the flight finally departed from Dabolim at 11 pm and reached Mumbai at 12.15 am. This incident highlights the pathetic approach of Vistara management towards their customers and their lack of commitment.",Domestic,3.0,December 2023,26 December 2023,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0

Terrible travel experience with Vistara Airlines,Fazal K,Mumbai - Dubai,"Excited for the trip to Dubai with my parents who are in the 90 years plus range. Thought we had all instructions in the Vistara System about Wheelchair assistance for both of them...wrong!
Once dropped off at Airport...no sign of any Wheelchair assistance and had to walk both aged parents near the check in counter and insist that they provide wheelchairs....got 2 wheel chairs...checked in and then we were set aside  and had to wait another 30-40 minutes (after constant insistence) before a person was assigned to wheel both of them through Immigration and customs...this went smoothly and were dropped off at the gate and advised that before boarding we would have someone come and deliver us to the gate of the aircraft.
Boarding was ""chaotic""...no special privilege (priority boarding due to premium economy) given to ""handicap persons or people requiring additional time to board......IN FACT, my repeated requests to the gate staff to get persons to push the wheel chair went ""un heeded"" and until I ""physically"" made my parents walk (carrying my carry on items) to the gate and get 
serious"" with the ground crew....that finally 2 members show up with wheel chairs to take my parents down to the gate of the aircraft!!.
Entered aircraft with some flight attendant assistance and landed in Dubai where there were 2 wheelchairs waiting...this procedure went smoothly!
Come, return to India time, I found general airport customer service and insisted they provide 2 wheel chairs...they finally obliged even though VISTARA had not informed them.
Checked in and insisted 2 wheel chairs which we got and went through Immigration and Customs without a hitch...we were dropped off at the gate and informed that someone would be there about 15 minutes prior to boarding to take us to the aircraft.
Come Boarding time.....""CHAOTIC AGAIN""...absolute lack of control by ""gate staff to organize boarding process""...they shold have again given priority to handicap and people travelling with children.
MOST IMPORTANT - I requested about 20 minutes prior to boarding time to gate staff to request 2 persons for wheel chair assitance...they assured me we would be taken care of....GUESS WHAT...same old issues....nobody showed up!!!
Finally, I got stern with them and then 2 persons showed up and finally took us to the aircraft.

We landed in India...and (NO fault of airline) did not get a chute to exit through....we were ""luckily"" assigned a ramp which made it a little easier to exit aircraft (otherwise I am unsure how this would have played out since my Mom especially has difficulty with stairs).
Anyway, we got the wheelchair in the bus through a ramp...and found out later (i was on the opposite end of the bus) that the wheelchair assistance had left my MOM standing and taken the wheelchair off the bus???
Through the ""valued"" help of fellow passengers we were finally able to get her off with difficulty and make her walk inside the terminal where 2 wheel chairs were waiting...question is why did they not come to the bus so that my parents (especially Mom) would not have to walk the distance?

Looks like there is ""no compassion"" for persons with handicap by Vistara....and this is an airline owned by Singapore Air....What a difference in service levels!!!
VISTARA was given detailed instructions at the time of booing about special assistance...but, their ""CARELESS/COMPASSIONLESS ATTITUDE"" definately sets them apart from the foreign carriers who towards customer service!

Maybe, we are not important or just part of the few Citizens who  may not make a significant difference as to how any review would affect such a large airline...but, not speaking up...would be even worse!!

I feel strongly that a lot of their (VISTARA) customers get treated ""indifferently...especially people who are aged and have handicaps"" and probably accept the this as a fact of life...but, I am hoping that VISTARA takes this as an opportunity to improve their Customer Service levels and train ground staff to enact discipline in the way they do business.

Baggage allowance discrepancy with international flights,palak p,Ahmedabad - Mumbai,"I would like to take opportunity to submit review regarding vistara airline customer representative working at Ahmedabad airport/domestic terminal.
This is genuine concern for each and every passenger who is taking international connections. 

I genuinely feel that every customer who is taking connecting flights while travelling internationally should think twice before getting their connection through vistara airline. 
I was travelling from India to Canada and our tickets were booked through KLM in around mid December. 
When we were returning from India our first flight was operated through vistara airline and that was from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and then onwards we had connections though KLM

The reason behind giving this review is to make operational management aware that their customer representatives should respect  customers. 
First of all we all should have humanity. I felt at Ahmedabad airport the agent who was helping us ( Named Rubina Mansoori) she said as per their airline policies they only allow 7kg per hand baggage and there is no kids policy which is different than adults. 

I completely don’t understand why she should have said that. Our destination flight was through KLM and final destination was to Canada, so our baggage was prepared as per what was outlined in KLM which was as follows 
I was travelling with my 6 months old infant and my husband. 
Baggage allowance per adult as per KLM 
- 2 x 23 kg check in baggage 
- 1x carry on - maximum 12 kg 
- 1 personal team 
Baggage Allowance for infants as per KLM 
- 1x 10 kg check in baggage 
- 1x 12 kg carry on including baby care item

The agent at Ahmedabad who was working should have thought that the baggage was packed as per international/ inter continental travel and should have allowed us to keep it as it is, but she rather asked us to take 4 kya off of each hand bag and make infant’s 12 kg carry on luggage as 23 kg bag that has messed up everything as we had to
Check that in which had all baby care items which has compromised my infants routine while travelling and he was fussy quite often. The agent is 100% responsible for this. 
She was extremely rude while she was speaking to my husband and was having very stubborn attitude that she asked my husband that all carry on baggage which are weighing more than 7 kg should go in my kids 10 kg bag and make it 23 kg so we don’t have to pay extra!!!!!
Seriously first of all why we should pay extra when we have already paid our travelling expenses. 
We had to hurry ourselves and opened up 3 of the carry on luggage which were obviously weighing around 10-12 kg as per the international flight allowance. And the 10 kg bag which was not even big enough we had to put our stuff very carefully in the small bag and we were under extreme pressure and stress as our baby was being very cracky and agitated while we were waiting for the agent to figure out what she needs to do. When she is allowing us to take all the weights anyway what is the point of moving weights around in the baggage 
Please review KLM baggage allowance and make sure to follow same standards when allowing passengers to take domestic connections to KLM. 
People can not and would not be comfortable to open up their bags in front of everyone at the airport and specially when they are just taking their domestic flight for one hour just because your domestic rules are different! 
There was no common sense here! 
The heights were when she decided to tell us go to the side and make proper arrangements as per what she was telling in very bossy manner! She started helping next customer meanwhile. 

We didn’t have choice but follow what she said but why do they have such attitude at first place , I think they should have very polite conversation with all customers as we were not there to annoy them and it was not our fault that we had that many baggage because that exactly what we brought so we need to take it back ! Why would pay extra just because our domestic connection was operated by Vistara and just that silly agent was not understanding how the international connection works 

Humble request to management: please consider the baggage allowance as per the international standard and travelling airline. People would not pay extra when the they have already paid for their tickets. 

Another request please hire competent staff who can think critically and analyze the situation. 
This agent was smiling while talking, I do not understand what was so funny, someone from night authority should consider talk to her and let her know what kind of attitude she should carry while taking care of travellers at the airport. 
Have some respect and understand the situation rather being annoying and stubborn. 
Please be accommodating 

Please please don’t just book your connection through Vistara or be ready for consequences. 

I would appreciate a follow up from the team

Worst customer support and website portal/app,Pooja Hegde,Mumbai - Abu Dhabi,"This is the 3/4th time I’m flying Vistara and each time I attempt to upgrade the app/website accepts my card(tried multiple cards) but then the site/app throws and error with my money still deducted. This has happened quite a few times & I thought it was a one off thing but then figured the same thing can’t keep happening over and over again. My friends also have had the same experience. 

When you request customer support to help with the upgrade, there is a price difference of over 5k INR!?!? This clearly looks like some kind of scam going on wherein you’ll want the customer to directly contact you’ll for an upgrade so that you’ll can get the extra money!! If you’ll can’t fix your site, don’t send out upgrade emails to your customers! 

Apart from this, I’ve contacted customer support a few times and I’ve spoken to Puja & Nitin and both of them have placed me on hold multiple times (calls were around 25 and 28 mins) without a proper resolution. You need to learn to respect your customers time and if you can’t resolve an issue on time, just call back when you have a resolution! Both the times, I asked a callback from the supervisor as it looks like their supervisors(Nisha) don’t have the time to come online when customers call and then callback after hours! 

This review is a warning to any future customers to avoid using their scam upgrade tricks and just stick to your original booking or even better choose another airline that knows to respect their customers time and money!",International,1.0,December 2023,16 December 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Very bad experience - 6 hours delay, no compensation",Cédric J,Kathmandu - New Delhi,"Almost 6hours delay due to an issue with autorisation to take off from Kathmandou. We were supposed to visit New Delhi (we had applied for Indian visa’s and we had booked an hotel room in the city center), it was not possible anymore as we landed in the middle of the night and there was not enough time left before our next flight. 
A crew member told us there were many possibilities to sleep in the terminal and it appeared there was only one hotel, very expensive and without any room available. We were thus obliged to ‘sleep’ in the middle of the airport hall, a very good way to come back really tired from our holidays… 
In the end, we asked for a compensation (at least for our visa expenses and the hotel stay) and we got nothing else than apologies.

Making false promises on bassinets,Seaside559225,Paris - New Delhi,"Before booking the flight, I called customer care and asked whether we would be availaved with the bassinet or not and we were informed that the bassinet seats are given to the parents on a first come first serve basis. Once check-in was enabled we were assigned with default seats and they were not next to the bassinet so we called the customer care again to confirm. We were instructed by the customer care person to not change the default allocated seats and asked us to reach 4 hours before departure time to the airport as bassinet seats can only be assigned to parents at the airport while boarding. So we did as instructed and reached Paris airport before 4 hours departure but to our surprise all the bassinet seats were already sold out. As per ground staff there are 2 bassinets in economy out of which one bassinet is taken by a parent and other seat next to bassinet is assigned to a lady travelling alone. Ground staff assured us that they will make a request to the lady and ask her to swap the seat with one of us so we can have the bassinet for our daughter. When boarding was about to start(same ground staff present who said they will make the request) we reminded again to the staff but as per them the lady was still not there so we were again asked to go ahead and they will make a request once she board the flight and we again trusted them. Now once we boarded the flight , the crew in flight said they can not request someone to give their seats to us and it's no longer possible to have the bassinet seat.
The best thing we found in this entire scenario is that none of the bassinet seats were assigned to parents. All those seats were sold to individuals(we were lied by the ground staff saying that its given to a parent but all three person sitting were individuals and not even travelling together as a family) who paid for extra leg space so my question is why are those seats called bassinet seats at all and you even say it to parents that those seats are designed for parents travelling with kids and can be only given to the parents on first come first basis when this is not at all followed by your staff or your system anywhere? We requested multiple times from the customer care to let us choose those seats beforehand and we were even ready to pay for the charge also? I can not explain the trauma my wife and my daughter have gone through because of this. My daughter is just 5 months old and she was travelling for the first time and it was an 8 hours long journey. We called and requested Vistara staff a lot of times just to confirm about the process of bassinet seats. Even after doing this much followup a simple thing can not be done by your staff then am not sure how you are operating this big airline. We would have happily travelled with our daughter without bassinet if those seats were given to other parents with higher needs but those seats were assigned to individuals with no kids while others were just struggling with their kids.",International,1.0,November 2023,28 November 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"Review of Vistara Airlines Flight from DED to DEL: Delay, Chaos, and Boarding Challenges",GyanBaba,Dehradun - New Delhi,"My experience with Vistara Airlines on a flight from DED to DEL was rather disappointing. The flight was notably delayed, and what frustrated me more was the lack of timely announcements. Passengers were left in the dark about the delay, creating confusion and frustration at the boarding gate.

The boarding process itself was chaotic, with the airline staff seemingly indifferent to the disarray. This lack of organization further amplified the inconvenience for passengers. Instead of using a ramp for boarding, only stairs were attached to the airplane, posing challenges for senior citizens and anyone with mobility issues.

The choice to forego a ramp for boarding seemed impractical and insensitive to the diverse needs of passengers. The airline staff's apparent enjoyment of the chaos at the boarding gate added to the overall negative impression. While I understand that delays can happen, clear communication and a more considerate approach to passenger needs would have significantly improved the overall experience. Vistara Airlines has room for improvement in ensuring timely and transparent communication, as well as a more organized and passenger-friendly boarding process.",Domestic,1.0,November 2023,27 November 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Ruthless behavior at Vistara Boarding with a 70 year old Wheelchair passenger,Sneha T,Mumbai - Dubai,"The supervisor in blazer at the boarding was unprofessional and rude.

This is not how a senior staff of Vistara Airlines must behave with a senior citizen of 70 years old. Worst experience with Vistara staff.

I have travelled a lot, and India should be proud of a service like Vistara, which is par excellence in comparison to many international flights which offer cheap economy services. Honestly, I'd choose Vistara over ANY airlines, for any journey (long or short) - because of the inflight experience, and I hope they continue to maintain this quality. The food is fresh, light, yummy, tasty. Flight/cabin crew is quick, efficient, attentive. The legroom is average/decent (depending on the class you take but I never felt any discomfort). There's inflight entertainment and games on your screen even on a domestic flight - what more can you ask for? Bathrooms are clean and really well designed. I only think that adding some more punctuality and being more proactive about providing more information in advance about the flight more clearly would make Vistara even more competitive and desirable. They should focus on doing such things, such as sending the gate number for boarding to the passenger's mobile number an hour earlier if the passenger has web-checked-in more than 24 hours ago when the gate number was unknown. I had already checked in online and could not find the gate number at the airport because it was not on my eboarding pass, which made me quite late to board the flight, and that was the only thing that turned into a harrowing experience.

Bad or I can say worst experience with international flight and  Good experience with domestic flight 
I had a connecting flight from London to Delhi n then from Delhi to Lucknow.
For my international flight from London to Delhi I had bad experience, at first  our flight delayed by 2 hours because of some issues, flight time was 10.20 pm we were informed by the cabin crew the flight only, for hours no snacks were served, even my entertainment screen was not working I ask them even 4-5 times to fix it, but everytime they only said yes, but nothing happened, even wifi was not working, no entertainment nothing. 
Second problem
 At the checkin counter I was informed that I have to transfer my luggage by myself only, which is not mention anywhere else I guess. So as I my flight was delayed n my layover time is of 2.40 hrs only so I was told afterwards that I will get my luggage at the Lucknow airport only, not to worry, just have to fill a form once we reach at the Lucknow airport, we got less time like 30 minutes around, one of the Vistar assistant told me and the other lady who is pregnant and aslo carried her small baby in her arm,to run in order to catch the Lucknow flight.

Treat Indians like 2nd class citizens.,Bhupi s,Mumbai - London,"I have recently flown from chennai to Mumbai to London. Below is my experience which I would like to share.

Check in experience at Chennai- The ground staff had very cold and robotic experiences when I or others fellow Indian were doing check In. Constantly checking my passport and visa, I lived in UK for more than 15 years but she was still asking me questions like it’s my first time going abroad. Next to me there was a foreigner he was greeted like a VIP and they were asking him about how was his experience in India and we value our culture and hospitality. 

After lending to the Mumbai I did my security and immigration (they were very nice and polite knew what they were looking for and cleared me in minutes).

Boarding experience - After the announcement we all started getting in the line for the boarding. Now one of the staff started to check passports and he segregates all the Indian passport holders to other line. Now we see UK passport holders to get in to the plane while we standing in other line to wait our passport and visa checked again. They started questioning why I am going to UK, where is the Visa, what type of visa is this (they had very lack of knowledge about types of visas it took me 15 min to make them understand the type of visa I had) they were behaving like an immigration officer, while we see foreigners going into the plane like VIP’s.

In flight experience- Again you can clearly see how less interested they are serving to us than comparing to the foreigners.  No interaction with us but asking foreigners if they need anything and serving them like they have paid extra than me.

In my front seat there were two foreigners. They were constantly getting things and getting well looked after. In whole duration I had to ask 3 times to just get a water and at the end she gave it to me like I am a bagger. 

After lending as we go out of plane we normally thanks cabin crew for the hospitality. As they were very chatty with foreigners but when I said thanks they gave me looks like I am an eve teaser.

I have only two thoughts here 

1 why airline staff behave like immigration officers while we already got cleared by Indian government officers, are they not credible enough?

2 if we don’t respect our own citizens then we will not get respect in others countries, they will take this behaviour as guidelines.",International,1.0,August 2023,26 August 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
My terrible experience as an underaged minor,Go36246908573,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),Had a terrible experience as an underaged minor. The staff at the counter we're rather rude. Had to pay 2500 rupees for assistance which was not worth it. When we flew back from Kochi to Delhi the staff said we didn't need assistance therefore we didn't have to pay.

My argument here is there were all together 8 tickets considering its a round trip. What kind of system is that, it allows this blunder to happen, without asking if all purchases are to be cancelled or without asking which tickets to be cancelled or which dates to be cancelled. 

So your tickets can be cancelled without consent and confirmation or even with blunder and you have to pay hefty price for it. Having run international flights you have to keep your system in international standards or else it will look like organised scam.

TERRIFYING EVENT,Pavan Kumar B,Abu Dhabi - Chennai (Madras),"The worst experience I've ever had.
We flew with Vistar from AUH to MAA Airport through BOM Airport, we flew with Vistara. 

Chapter 1: Alternate Boarding Terminal
===========================================================
Bitter experience began at the airport of origin, Abu Dhabi airport. E-boarding pass instructed to board at terminal 1. 
We called Vistara's customer service line and double-checked which terminal to go to. They will undoubtedly arrive at terminal 1. 
However, after we got to the airport, check-in had been moved from terminal 1 to terminal 3. With little children, our entire family had to sprint from airport 1 to terminal 3. The staff explained that they switched from terminal 1 to terminal 3 due to a shortage of check-in belts. 

Once check-in was finished once more, we were instructed to go to Gate 9 in Terminal 1.

30 minutes prior to departure, gate 9 was switched to gate 10. To announce this, none of the Vistara staff arrived at gate number 9.  

Chapter 2: Landing delay 
===========================

The flight arrived at the Mumbai airport after a 40-minute delay. Within two hours, we had a connecting flight from BOM to MAA. 
We had to race to the immigration checkpoint, grab our luggage, and drop it off at the domestic check-in booths in under 40 minutes.
The Vistara workers instructed us to leave our luggage trolleys at the domestic check-in kiosks and they would take care of loading them. 
Trusting them, we left our bags there.

Due to the fact that there were barely 15 minutes remaining before takeoff, vistara employees ordered us to board the aircraft. 

Chapter 3: Sarp Drop 
============================

In spite of the severe weather, the airplane took off from Mumbai. Due to turbulence, the flight experienced a fast descent from a high altitude once it had risen to about 1500 feet. Everyone on board began to scream, acting as though the plane was about to crash. 
We had no hope that we would land in one piece till we got to MAA airport. 

Chapter 4 :Discrepancy in luggage
=========================================================================

By the grace of God, we arrived at the MAA airport and proceeded to the luggage belts to retrieve our belongings. Few travelers had retrieved their bags. After waiting for more than 40 minutes, our baggage were nowhere to be seen. The luggage of nearly 20 families was not transported from BOM to MAA. 

We went to the missing baggage counter, but the clerk had no idea whether the luggage was still secure at the BOM airport. 
After an hour, they took our information and the complaint, but they did not provide a complaint reference number before asking us to go. They informed us that it would take more than two hours to establish a TIR number when we asked for a reference number.

We had no choice but to depart for the airport. MAA airport is 350 kilometers from our hometown.

We had to phone Vistara's customer service and luggage counter several times before we finally got an answer that they will be delivering us at the door step.

Nightmare and Worst Experience with Vistara !!,Ritesh K,Pune - New Delhi,"We recently traveled with Vistara from LEH[IXL] to Pune via Delhi. [ UK-602 ].

It was the worst experience of our life and the flight manager at Leh Airport did not allow us to board the flight stating we are late and onboarding is closed.

However, the onboarding time given was 8.35 and we were at the airport at the same time.
We were tourists with lot of luggage and a 2 years Baby with us.

He and the Vistara team denied the onboarding and at last, he agreed to let 3 adults and 1 child let on board with only handbags to fly.

One of our family members needs to stay back and then take all the luggage with him and then travel to Delhi to catch the connected flight to Pune by paying almost 35k INR due to the emergency ticket and luggage price to Indigo.

We strongly believe this was false off-boarding of our family member to flight as the seat 24B was completely occupied during the fly from Leh to Delhi [ It should have been empty as one of our family members was offboarded.",Domestic,1.0,June 2023,21 June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

WORST CABIN CREW AND IN-FLIGHT EXPERIENCE,Voyager21795604428,London - Mumbai,"Worst inflight cabin crew experience. They are busy giving world class experience only to business and premium economy class passengers. In y entire journey i had asked only for room temperature or warm water to take my medicine for which the crew said she will take time since she is busy and then she never gave me the water. Even after pressing the bell for assistance she arrived after 20-25 mins. I don't know what is so difficult to serve as basic as water to the passengers. All the crew ladies were looking frustated and irritated. When the flight meals started instead of asking if the passenger wants to have a drink , they served drink and the food tray together , but the same wasn't done in business and premium economy. Shame to get these kind of experience from cabin crew whose only job is to make the flight journey for each passenger easy, nice and comfortable.

"Harassment by male baggage handler and female Vistara staff at gate 65A Mumbai airport on May 27, 2023.",Traveller Forever,Mumbai - Varanasi,"This whole incident occurred at 12:45 pm or 12:50 pm at gate number 65A on 27th May 2023.

I and my parents were traveling from Mumbai to Varanasi today which is May 27, 2023, and the gate number was 65A. Each of us had our trolley bags which altogether makes it 3 trolley bags. The departure time was 1:30 pm and we began boarding at around 12:45 or 12:50 pm. 

The gate number was 65A and the flight number was UK621. When our turn came to board the flight, there was one female Vistara staff aged 50+ years in a black coat who all of a sudden came and stood at the gate, and started instructing us that ""Why did you carry such huge bags? You are not supposed to carry such big bags on air."" ""You will not board unless I check the weight of your bags."" She pulled the bag from my mother's hand and stopped her. 

These are the exact words she used and snatched my mother's trolley bag from her hand.

Later a male baggage handler came and threatened us that he will not let us board the flight unless our bags are weighed. We told the female Vistara staff and the baggage handler that we have already checked the weights of our bags at home and at the airport before boarding at the check-in counter. At the check-in counter, we told the authority that we wish to carry our bags and that's when she checked the weight of our bags and let us take them. To this, the baggage handler said, ""We are not your slaves, you are the slaves right now so you cannot board the flight unless we tell you to, and unless we check the weight of your bags."" ""You will need to check in the bags and not carry them. He threatened us to not board the flight.""

The baggage handler said that ""You people who board the flight are our slaves and you need to do as we say."" These were his exact words. You will not board the flight until I bring the weighing scale and check your baggage weight. Calling us slaves and threatening us to not board the flight is unethical, illegal, and unfair as we pay charges for our flight. Is a ground staff baggage handler allowed to call passengers a slave even when we did not call him or abuse him?

I answered back at him that we have checked the weight of our bags and said that we cannot threaten to not board the flight. I also asked him to behave himself but he did not stop and the female Vistara attendant kept supporting him and did not stop him. 

We have come to Varanasi for just one day and why would we carry many things with us? Nobody would want to pick up heavy bags and place them above the seats on the flight. People don't carry the entire household with them everywhere they go via a flight that is just 2 hours away from a certain destination. Our bags were of the accurate size and we always carry these bags while traveling through Indigo, SpiceJet, and other airlines, but no airline staff has ever told us to weigh the bags during boarding at the gate and threatened us to not board the flight unlike in Vistara.

On the morning of 28th May 2023, a Vistara staff member called my father. He handed the phone to me and the Vistara staff told me that the airport authority of Mumbai airport addressed my complaint to Vistara ground staff appointed at gate 65A on 27th May 2023 and the deputy manager of Vistara Airlines. Instead of telling the truth, the deputy manager of Vistara, as well as the baggage handler and the female Vistara staff at gate no. 65 at Mumbai airport accused me of abusing them. I asked her do you have proof of the abuses and told me what abuses did I use? She said the ground staff did not give them the proof. I told her to pass on my message to the ground staff of Vistara at gate 65 which was appointed there on 27th May 2023, that I will reach the higher authority of Vistara Airlines and complain about the incident as well as the baggage handler and the Vistara female staff. I had to argue with the baggage handler and the Vistara female staff because they threatened me and my mother that they will not let us board the flight unless they weigh our bags. If it was somebody else was in my place even they would have argued with them because we pay for our flights and not letting us board is a crime on behalf of the airline ground staff. But in the process of argument, I could not abuse because my parents were with me and I cannot abuse them in front of them as it is unethical. Rather, the ground staff called us a slave and told us that we have to listen to what we said.

A baggage handler had no job at the gate. His job is to only handle the baggage of the passengers yet he interfered in our conversation with the Vistara female staff member, and was at the gate and threatened us to not board the flight unless he brings the weighing scale. 

My mother was carrying her small purse as well as one handbag which only had food and one trolley bag which is of the size that always fits in the compartment above the seat. She cannot check in the handbag which had food and yet was forced to stop and not board the flight until her bags are weighed. I was carrying one trolley bag that also fits in the compartment above the seat, and my father was carrying one trolley bag only. We always carry these many bags only when we travel by indigo and SpiceJet, but nobody told us to check in the trolley bag, purse, and handbag which has food. Telling to check in trolley bags is ok, but commenting on the size, and forcing others to check the weight of all bags at the gate is wrong. They are not supposed to do that at the gate, because it was already done at the check-in counter and we were allowed to carry our bags with us because it was under the permissible weight and food cannot be checked in. 

It is unfair to accuse passengers of abuse without proof. When I asked the female staff today on the phone call, she said they do not have proof of you abusing them. Then on what basis can the deputy manager not take action against the ground staff and accuse me of abusing them?

If I had to abuse somebody, I would have done that many times in the past as I am a frequent traveler. But, I never felt the need to complain about any ground staff at Mumbai airport because they are all good and kind to us. This is the first time I got this experience with the ground staff at Vistara gate no. 65.
Travelers do not plan at home that they will take hold of a staff member at the airport, blame them for no reason, and then complain.

I have never complained about any Airline before this, but baggage handlers calling passengers a slave is not at all right. I do not recommend flying with Vistara if families or even an individual wants to fly peacefully.",Domestic,4.0,May 2023,6 June 2023,4.0,4.0,N/A,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0

Review - 1st International Trip by Vistara to London from Mumbai via Delhi.,Alok Chokhani,Mumbai - London,"I am a frequent overseas traveller due to my work and for few reason decided to try Vistara for a flight to London via Delhi while I reside in Mumbai.
Travelled on 29 May via UK994 and UK17
1.	Unlike BA or AA they don’t have a minimum 3 day stay rule for reduced fares for travel, so got the tickets at a decent price as I had to go for a short business trip.
2.	The return timing was good and am scheduled to reach Mumbai ~ 3pm with a changeover in Delhi. BA has cancelled the night flight from London on few days ☹

To share my experience on the entire process/travel with Vistara to London from Mumbai via Delhi.
Mumbai Airport: I was not aware if should go to International or Domestic Checkin counters, so went to International but was asked to goto Domestic as was flying via Delhi to London, I believe the International counter could have also checked in and I was literally the ONLY passenger there.
I went to the domestic Business class counter to check-in, the person there was not so polite/kind. I was enquiring on the Star Alliance as I am a Star Alliance Gold member as well and thought Vistara was also a member airline and my United FF number was on the boarding and status not showing up. seems she felt irritated as I was asking about the lounge access being a gold member, I was then told to check this at the lounge and Vistara cannot do anything.

Delhi Airport: 
Upon Arrival, I went to the Transfer Desk of Vistara, the person checked my passport etc and was directed to the International Transfers. Surprisingly the Delhi airport transfers had only 1 person for passport control and when I asked him, said, has called twice for more people but no positive response. I went back to the long queue.
After waiting in line for 30 mins, the same person from Vistara transfer desk comes and asks us to go to 2nd floor for immigration, so not only we had a long walk but also again had to wait in line for another ~30 mins for the security clearance, if directions could have been given correctly at one go, would have helped.

Inflight to London:
The aircraft was new, nice seats, good washroom – spacious and bright with a see through window! The staff was also very polite and the meal was decent I would say with the Indian taste, which I HATE in BA.
Washrooms though nice, the quality of paper napkins needs to improve a lot! All the bottles, hand cream(Good one), mouthwash (hope can keep small separate bottles for hygiene) are oversized for the space available. The Soap dispenser had to press at least 10-15 times for the soap to come out (was too thick for the pump)
Few nuances: To activate the inflight internet service, you cannot use Domestic (India) Issued cards! Wow.. that was a first for me and on payment options you have Master, Visa and Rupay (which is only in India) and the payment is managed by ICICI Bank, no AMEX either, so how are Indian’s suppose to use it who don’t have Internationally issued cards? I enquired with the team and they said cant help on this and hardly ever received a complaint.
Don’t know how others work around this? I tried 3 credit cards, but failed as all were issued in India. 
Mid-air, the entertainment system stopped working and was reset with ~ 10-15 min process to come back and after that as well most of the movies were not working!
Vistara needs to work on their tech. and processes.

London Arrivals:
Bags were already removed and kept aside by the time I cleared immigration and was a breeze!

Final Take: If not much of a price difference, will AVOID taking Vistara, especially via Delhi
1.	Extra ~4 hours than a direct flight
2.	Immigration in Delhi and extra 1 more security line
3.	Most Indian’s cannot buy inflight internet due to card restrictions, it is essential for work on a long flight.
4.	Not part of Star Alliance or One World, so no benefits of being the Top Tier member, hopefully gets resolved with Air India merger.
5.	Poor International connectivity, so in case of a missed flight, wait can be until next day.",International,4.0,May 2023,29 May 2023,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0
Worst experience ever,Dilasha,Kathmandu - Male,"Worst experience ever, Ground staff were very rude in Mumbai. They lied to your face. Changed there statement every minute. We had hotel booked outside the airport as the transit was 18hours and since Nepalese Citizen doesn’t need visa in India. Staff didn’t let us go out and threaten us to cancel our flight if we go out. They said ‘ If any of you go out we know your face and seat number we can’t guarantee that you guys will travel to Male tomorrow”. We requested to speak to immigration but they didn’t let us speak to immi either, they took our passport and ticket and forced us to go to boarding area and asked us to stay at the airport hotel. There were 7 of us but they didn’t let us stay and forced us in .. after that we were not allowed to go out. They were very rude, shouting at the passenger in ground.

Amazing cabin crew - but poor on-time performance,Pratyay,London - New Delhi,"It was my first time travelling international with Vistara. I had flown with them only on domestic routes before & always had a good experience. However, this flight was not up to the usual standard. Firstly - the number of check-in counters at Heathrow were not sufficient for the 260+ passengers flying onboard which made the check-in process very tiresome with long queue times. Next, the incoming flight was delayed by 2 hours which pushed OUR departure time further. It was very frustrating waiting at the airport for so long and, the Vistara ground staff at Heathrow were NOT cooperative and made excuses for the delay - and took no accountability. Boarding was SO chaotic and for economy passengers - boarding was NOT done in a row-number-wise fashion which led to further delays. The aircraft was not cleaned properly, and the pillow had hair in it. The screen and the tray table were dirty too.

The star of the flight was the cabin crew. They were very kind and helpful. They had a smile on their faces and tirelessly worked for 8+ hours. Kudos to them. They really made this journey 10x better. The food was good - although - not as good as onboard their domestic sectors. 

I would not mind flying international with Vistara again provided they improve their punctuality a bit. A lot of passengers were connecting onwards from Delhi and feared they would miss their onward flight due to the severe delay.

Poor ecommerce and technical functionality to support policies,Savvytraveler501,Dubai - Mumbai,"It is a painful experience to deal with Vistara's self service applications. Log in functionality is very poor - I have been trying for a year to create a log in - have tried multiple times and ways, but one thing or another keeps failing. Have no such problem with any other airline. Upgrade policy is very poorly supported with poor technology. If you use name in lieu of letter or v.v., the system will reject request and no God can seem to authorize it against a very inadequate functional logic. Many a times I have booked on other airlines because I could not deal with Vistara's lack technical functionality. And I refuse to deal with no-can-do call centers. Damaged checked bag resolution is despicable. Airport refers to customer care who refers back to airport. Then customer care proceeds to close the case because they don't read their emails. Now the merger with Air India will likely create more pain points before it gets better - for a country that outsources tech help, surely the airlines should do better by hiring better decision makers who can think global to match with airlines ambition to be global. Indian airlines often have the worst websites...

"Baby Bassinet seat - Never get it, do not try as they sold to Non baby customer",Atul K,New Delhi - London,"I travelled in February with Vistara with my 6 month daughter from UK to Delhi. I had raised complaint about bassinet service in one of my return journey from Delhi to London. As per website, they guranteed to take care of baby on flight and provide bassinet but in reality was completely different.
When i flew back, they said in flight only one bassinet there in whole economy flight and that also reserved. basically by looking international flight, 5 seat are always there but they sold basinet seat to the other customer for few bucks. Even though i got confirm seat from airport. Through out my complaint, only said one word of Sorry for any inconvenience.

Organised Fraud & Cheating by Vistara,Radhika Dhawan,New Delhi - Frankfurt,"Harrowing experience with the airlines - booked my parents on a 9hr Vistara flight from Delhi to Frankfurt (PNR 5YAZIQ). Pre booked & paid Rs. 13,000/- over & above the air fare for Emergency Exit Row Seats that werwe confirmed on portal (46J & 46K). Upon boarding my parents realised that seats  were wrongly assigned at check in counter at airport (43C & 43B - unpaid seats)

Ground staff firmly asserted that we were mistaken or payment did not go through & hence seats were not booked. They could do nothing about it as seats were assigned to other passengers.

Post providing them with relevant proof of payment & screenshots of  booked seats on the CV portal - instead of gracefully accepting the mistake at their end & resolving the matter the ground staff mentioned that as per them my parents requested the staff at Check In counter to NOT allocate the pre booked Exit Row seats and insisted they be given unpaid middle seats. 

Rather than being apologetic - the ground staff mentally harassed my parents by not giving the seats they duly paid for, and suggested they simply claim a refund on email and settle with the given seats or simply de board the flight and take the next one as an ultimatum.

Not only were they denied the seats without any reason whatsoever but were also misbehaved with and spoken to with utter disrespect as if they were asking for something extra. Let alone allocating the right seats or providing with an upgrade as a token of apology, the ground staff refused to even share their names or the reason for not allocating them the booked seats. I thoroughly regret my decision of booking with Vistara instead of its counterparts that fly to the same destination at similar times and lesser prices. 

What is the point of pre booking seats when eventually the airlines will allocate as it pleases. We paid in advance so we do not have to “request” for exit seats / aisle seats while checking in. 

Equally disappointed with response on the helpline number - was casually suggested to ""claim a refund which normally the airlines is ‘not liable’ to pay and that maybe passengers were physically unfit to sit on exit seats"". Wrong seats were assigned at the check in counter itself and boarding pass was issued. Seats were not changed upon boarding or due to being ""unfit"". Neither do my parents have any physical disabilities / health conditions making them fit to sit on the emergency exit seats and neither were any questions pertaining to their health / medical conditions asked by the staff basis which this decision could have been made.

A joint venture between Tata & SIA - both renowned for their incomparable hospitality & service and yet the ground staff thought that asking to claim a refund would suffice and compensate for the panic and embarrassment my parents went through before boarding the flight, and inconvenience and discomfort they faced during the flight. It is due to the incompetence of your staff & lags in your back end & technical team that my parents had to face everything I stated above.

We have still not received any kind of apology from your airlines or staff on the matter despite countless calls and mails since morning.",International,1.0,May 2023,8 May 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0

A Disastrous Experience with Vistara:  Highway Robbery in the Sky,Law P,New Delhi - Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum),"I cannot put into words the utter disappointment and frustration I experienced with Vistara. This is the first time I am booking a flight with them and it is very unlikely I will ever book with them again.  My trust in their services has been shattered, and I feel compelled to share my experience in the hope that it might save others from a similar debacle.

First and foremost, I had paid for an upgrade on my flight, a simple transaction one might expect to go smoothly. However, that was far from the case. The airline deducted the funds from my account, but failed to actually upgrade my seat as requested.

Hoping that it was merely an oversight, I contacted their customer service to resolve the issue. It was at this point that I became truly disenchanted with Vistara. I was met with a barrage of delays, excuses, and empty promises. The customer service team was unresponsive and evasive, making no effort to correct the problem. What is worse and this is where I am pissed of and what I feel should be a class action law suit against them is the fact that they knew the website has a problem, they offer upgrade when checking in online, and when we pay, we are not given the option to upgrade. It will take us back to the economy and then money is deducted, we are left with the extremely frustrating job of contacting them and getting a refund. 

 It felt like I was being robbed in broad daylight, with the added insult of the airline's seeming indifference to my plight. And they freaking know about this. I wonder how many people are experiencing the same issue. 

In summary, my experience with VIstara has left me with a profound sense of disillusionment. I am astounded by their lack of professionalism, their inability to provide the services I paid for, and their abject disregard for customer satisfaction. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this airline to anyone, and I will certainly be looking elsewhere for my future travel needs.

Extremely disappointed with Vistara's service and handling of lost luggage,Ncognito,Bengaluru - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I recently flew with Vistara Airlines, and I am extremely disappointed with the experience. The airline managed to lose my expensive luggage, and the way they have handled the situation has been nothing short of appalling.

Firstly, the lack of communication from Vistara has been incredibly frustrating. Despite my numerous attempts to contact their Priority Connect service and the Operations Team at the airport, I have received no concrete information or assistance in locating my lost luggage. The staff's lackluster attitude and reluctance to take responsibility for their mistake has only added to the stress of the situation.

Moreover, the fact that my luggage contained a highly valuable item makes this experience even more distressing. Vistara has shown no empathy or understanding of the gravity of the situation, and they have yet to offer even a simple apology for their negligence.

The entire ordeal has left me feeling disheartened and disrespected as a customer. It is unfortunate that an airline of Vistara's reputation has failed so miserably in providing basic customer service and addressing a serious issue like lost luggage. It is evident that their customer care is severely lacking, and it has made me question whether I would ever consider flying with them again.

In summary, my experience with Vistara Airlines has been extremely negative. Their poor handling of my lost luggage, lack of communication, and unprofessional attitude have left a lasting impression on me as a customer. I strongly advise potential passengers to consider alternative airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and are willing to take responsibility for their actions.",Domestic,1.0,April 2023,5 April 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

A new low.....Vistara Business Class...Lowest Priority in delivering checked-in luggage at Guwahati Airport,Subbi,New Delhi - Guwahati,"Travelled Vistara business class with family on a leisure trip in Chennai-Delhi-Guwahati sector. While the in-flight service was exemplary in all the sectors, the ground services were poor, starting from check-in at Chennai, lounge facility in Chennai & the baggage delivery at Guwahati airport. Here is my account of these:

1. The lady manning the business class check-in counter was so grim faced & could not even offer a welcome smile to us! We checked in two luggages that she tagged as PRIORITY, being business class, and told us they will be delivered on prority basis at Guwahati. Our boarding passes had an invitation to the TFS Lounge facility near Gate no.3.

2. Upon showing our boarding passes at tge TFS Lounge, we were immediately guided to the Copper Chimney restaurant & told to use that as lounge as well. They were allowing credit card holders & other airlines passengers into the lounge. Anyways we had our breakfast in Copper Chimney. It was too crowded & it certainly was not like a lounge. The tables & chairs were placed too cramped as they do in mediocre eateries. No newspapers were available. After breakfast I approached the lounge staff again & asked them why they were discouraging many people from entering their lounge. At this, they reluctantly allowed us in. Inside it was not crowded & plenty of decent sofas were available. Vistara should seriously look into this discrimination by TFS Lounge staff that may discourage business class travellers.

3. Worst experience was yet to be witnessed by us at Guwahati airport. One of our luggages marked PRIORITY was the last to arrive on the conveyer belt, long after all economy class passengers left with their luggages. We realised Vistara has a new definition for PRIORITY, by prefixing LOW  & making it LOW PRIORITY for business class travellers. The ground staff were clueless & unable to help us out as we waited close to 30 mins for our PRIORITY luggage. Finally the manager came to our help just when the luggage arrived on the belt and all other passengers had left. She was apologetic & extended a nice gesture of escorting us out of the airport, talked in local language with a taxi driver & seeing us off. Vistara should train their staff better to handle PRIORITY luggages of business class travellers.

 Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the in-flight service, well curated menu, etc. were excellent and on this account, I would give another chance to Vistara to rectify the above with respect to the ground staff.",Domestic,3.0,March 2023,25 March 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Worst Flight Ever,Manish,Mumbai - Varanasi,"Worst Airline I ever travelled with. I missed my connecting flight at Mumbai.
They keep blaming other airline for all the rebook issue.
They even don’t refunded and the worst, my luggage was at Mumbai airport as well but took 5 hours to be reached to me. I was travelling with my 2 infants. Imagine how awful they treated us. All the staff were rude, not helpful and blaming each others.

"Not trustful, bad service,",Rainer E,Frankfurt - New Delhi,"By description of Vistara Premium Economy seats should have been wider, more comfortable, more seat tilt, more seat adjustment options with adjustable leg rests, differentiated armrests, a larger screen and 2/3/2 seating. All of this is promised on the website when flying on a Vistara Dreamliner.
None of this existed in reality.
There were normal economy class seats, in a different color, a little more legroom, the same screens, etc. It's not really clear what the surcharge was for. Could have been saved. I and other passengers reacted correspondingly irritated.
The staff was far from being friendly and helpful. It looked tense.
Vistara only responds to letters with a complaint with automated reply letters and a note that the mail has arrived and a case number. That was it already! There were no further replies or an interest in clarification even after 2 weeks. Service is definitely a foreign word at Vistara! One lags far behind one's own published claims, as well as the provision of service descriptions. Beautiful words, pictures and videos on the Internet are not enough to move in the circle of well-known airlines. What counts is performance and service in order to win and keep the trust of customers. Vitara does not currently have this willingness/knowledge.
The apology received in the meantime includes that due to Vistara's internal changes, services may no longer be available. That's it, no refund of the overpaid amount, no suggestion of another solution. I should only take note of the service that was not rendered, apologize and accept it as a unique situation. Now courts have to decide. Bad service, Bad performance, Vistara is not recommended.",International,3.0,February 2023,18 March 2023,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

HOBBLIE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AIRLINES BEING ON A BUSINESSCLASS CUSTOMER,Reya M,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Mumbai,We traveled business class from Kolkata to Mumbai. It was a horrible experience. They kept on changing the time for departure. First it was 8:40 pm to 12:00 am to 12:40 am to 1:40 pm. Didn't have an emergency plan or a back of plan nor did they care that I had an international ticket going to the USA.  I kept on telling the customer rep that was on the front desk that I have an international ticket going back to the country tonight. I need to reach Mumbai for my ongoing flight to the USA with Turkish airlines at 5:00 AM. If I don't make it to Mumbai on time I'll be stuck. They said they can't do anything about it. Then I told them mom is a high diabetic patient. If I don't make it back to the USA she will have no more medicine and the medicine she takes is only in the USA. It's urgent that I make it back to the county. I was shocked when they said what do you want me to do about that. I said I just want to please know what time the flight is going to depart and what time I will make it to Mumbai.  But they didn't even know what to really tell me or weren't able to rebook on a different do anything so i was very unhappy being at the airport for nine hours.

Vistara did not fulfill its promise and yet to refund the amount.,Saunak,Mumbai - Bengaluru,"We were travellig premium economy Mum-Blr and return back on same class. we were 5 adults, 1 child and 1 infant. I had availled a special service to celebrate my brothers birthday on air.  I made a payment of INR500 for that. To our suprise no such arrangements were made on flight. 
It was very disapponting to see such a service as the child who was travelling with us would have loved to celebrate her fathers birthday on air. 
Also, since it was premium eco we were given a menu card to make a choice of food. The option which we opted for was not available and the crew told us to accept refrehments which was availabe. How bad it looks that after been given a menu card you have to accpet what is available. Also the starbucks coffee which we wanted was not available.
After making a complaint on their customre care id we were told that a refund woud be made and INR500 as compensation. it has been almost 2.5 months and no refund or compensation has been made yet.

Worst Airline with Cheap Staff,Meander761224,Amritsar - New Delhi,"Probably the worst Airline experience EVER. Avoid. Dealt with Manager Kamaljit Singh of Amritsar Airport. Money grabbing agents asking for money at all stages.

We booked and payed for a Infact ticket and 2 adult tickets via reputable agent Expedia. Weight allowance 20kg each. Once we arrived at the airport with confirmed tickets we were told infant tickets are not allowed and the booking was a mistake as it should not have been allowed. Not sure how that is my fault but the fault of their booking system which is outdated and backwards. At an instance our baggage allowance was also decreased as our infant payed ticket cancelled. We were then made to wait 1.5 hours at the check in desk and put pressured and threatened by staff if we don’t pay for excess luggage (which was within the allowance, but cancelled as infants can’t have seat nor their own luggage) we can’t travel nor get a refund on all our tickets. This was 5 minutes before check in was due to close. 

Under pressure with a screaming baby we had no time to think nor rearrange luggage but paid the excess luggage fee and still charged full fair for an infant even tho we were told it’s not allowed.

This was all calculated and they made us wait until the last moment before demanding payment and dismissing all conversation. 

The  whole situation baffles me and puts the airline in my eyes the lowest grade of airline. Try IndiGo or even better the super fast train. 

My advice, get rid of cheap staff and have no common sense nor empathy. Kamaljit Singh being the  first. They walk around like royalty and have no sense of customer service or communication skills.

Due to their mechanical errors, and some selfish locals who wandered off, we missed our connecting flight in Singapore.  The airline customer service has been the worst I’ve ever had to deal with. We have been in Singapore for hours while vistara refuses to upgrade our tickets to premium economy to get us on the next flight. 

Our tickets were booked through Singapore airlines so both Singapore airlines and vistara Claim the other needs to approve it.

What happened today was beyond my expectation.

I had a flight from Mumbai to Jaipur at 11.45 am .Reached the airport in time and had to deal with roaming networks and security .

Reached the kiosk with no luggage sharp at 10.40 well before the stipulated time.Kiosk did not let me check in.

Speak to agent wZ the message.Agent put me in a line and reached end of line at 5 to 11.00.The young girl told me she can't help me and go to the supervisor.The supervisor checked her screens took my oci card and T 11.00 told me flight was closed.

I RATE THIS THE MOST UNFRIENDLY AIRLINE IN THE WORLD.

These stupid processes has cost me my return ticket my hotel bookings and my international flights.

Worst airline ever!! Vistara never ever,Neha D,London - New York City,"Booked Vistara for our trip from London to New Delhi with economy Flexi on the return trip which as advertised let you change and cancel the flight for free. To my horror when I tried to change the trip date it won't let me change the date online. I called up customer care in UK who are so clueless and don't want to be bothered.
I wrote an email to customer relationship and after a week got a rude reply that I can't change my return flight without being charged!!
The reason they gave me was that my flights on both sides need to be economy Flexi!!!
This was never made clear to me when I booked the flight!!!
They wanted me to shell another 1800£ to change the flight date.
I left it as it is ,but because the flights wer booked 10 months in advance,I had changed my name after marriage and wanted to reflect the same in my tickets
Again I couldn't change my surname on the ticket!!
This time the customer relationship won't even bother to reply to my email!!
I had to call the India no from UK and they refused to help me !!
I finally had to cancel my flight and was charged 700£ for it!!!
This is a con airline in the name of luxury!!
Please don't use this. They have so many hidden terms and conditions and they will con you and take your money using those!!!

No proper guidance or consideration by customer service team,Astha Rawat,Dehradun - Bengaluru,"I wanted to book a flight from Dehradun to Bangalore but in panic I instead booked  Dehradun to Bombay UK 865 instead of BLR. 

Vistara advised me to cancel this and make a new booking. To my shock, this new booking is of the exact same aircraft for the exact same time and same date and I could have been helped and guided correctly by the vistara team since my cancelled flight was going ahead to bangalore anyway. But instead they wanted to earn cancellation and new booking charges. 

It doesn't end there, i kept trying to seek an answer from vistara as to how is it okay to charge cancellation fee when my new booking was of same flight, even though i was happy to pay my new fare price. But one miss Teena Mathur, Senior Executive-Customer Relations decided that it's not worth their time to reasonably explain or engage in any exchange with me for 
1. no correct guidance
2. useless cancellation and rebooking of same flight

Worst airline in my experience,Escape254295,London - New Delhi,"I had booked a flexible return ticket which allows two changes. Changed the return date and was asked to pay . Took ages for the payment link to work and kept saying that the payment link doesn’t work. Finally did work and I could change the date. When I tried to check in- it said restrictions on check in. I upgraded the ticket from premium to business class- it took the payment but then showed error and didn’t show/send me upgraded ticket. Tried calling customer service in UK which was not helpful at all and said that your initial payment was not processed so you need to pay again. Requested another payment link and it kept saying card not valid. 
This was on the way to airport ad the flight was same  day. Had to make international call to India customer service who kept sending payment link which never worked despite using different Indian cards- won’t accept UK cards anyway.
Reached airport and at the ticket window was a very helpful lady who tried to help but said couldn’t modify the existing ticket- had to be done through India office at they didn’t have the right to modify the existing ticket/ booking. Offered the options to pay in cash- INR or GBP, card- Indian or Uk- but even she failed to pay through the payment link being sent by India office- spent 3 hours at the airport doing all this. 
Finally managed to pay for the date change but upgrade was not showing still despite taking money from my Indian account. Finally had to pay again for the business class upgrade do paid double the money for the airline system fault.
Would never travel again and would not recommend to anyone.
I have been travelling for last 30 years without any problems.

Án airline that doesn't care about its customers,Manasvi S,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"I have flown on numerous flights of Vistara primarily due to lack of options. Their economy class seats are so closely packed that as soon as the one in front reclines you feel as if you are in a straitjacket. Try calling them for an upgrade ( even if are willing to pay) and they will put you on music for a good 10--15 minutes and at the end of it, your call may be disconnected. Their frequent flyer program seems more like a scam. I have forfeited many points and would probably forfeit 16000 points soon as it is next to impossible to use the points for anything, whether you want to book or upgrade or whatever. 
The only reason this airline is surviving is because of lack of competition and  dynamic pricing ( extracting the maximum form those who need to travel in an emergency).

Avoid Vistara- Awful Customer Service,STan,Hyderabad - Detroit,"Our experience with Vistara Airlines was one that was extremely unprofessional and unpleasant. Upon arrival at the Hyderabad international airport, we waited in line for almost 1 hour to check-in & drop off our baggage. The bag drop line was not excessively long. However, the Vistara check-in workers on duty around 7PM at HYD on 2/11 showed no promptness or care for their passengers. Several passengers expressed concerns in line and the male manager wearing a gray coat did nothing to help until several passengers finally shouted at him.

After waiting for an hour to reach the check-in counter, the lady assisting us was messaging on WhatsApp in the middle of checking-in our baggage. This lady was sitting on her phone texting in the middle of weighing my bags and giving me my boarding pass. First I assumed “oh maybe she needs to send a quick message”. Then after a few minutes of seeing her texting, I finally said to her “can you get off your phone and do your job, I need to finish checking-in, I have a flight to catch.” The worker looked at me with no response. She stopped texting and finished checking me in. What kind of customer service is this?

What kind of worker texts in front of customers? Especially in an airport where punctuality is extremely necessary.

After all this, the worker asked me to keep my carry on baggage on the scale and told me that I had to check in my carry on luggage. When I asked why, she said “we are only allowing passengers who have an international destination to keep their carry on luggage.” I said “you can see that I am international. My final destination is DTW, why are you asking me to check this in?” She again had no response. I took my carry-on bag off the scale and said “I am keeping this with me.” I took my boarding pass and left.

More than 1 hour of my time in the airport was spent dealing with the disrespectful and unintelligent Vistara staff just for baggage drop. 

To top it off, boarding for the Vistara flight was delayed. After a long 24 hours of traveling from India to the US, one of my bags did not reach. During my journey, I flew Vistara, KLM, and Delta. I went to the Delta desk and filed a claim. Both Delta and KLM said the bag never left Hyderabad (Vistara). When I called Vistara, they told me they can’t track my bag. What kind of airlines is this? After endless phone calls, I finally received my baggage.  

Moral of the story, don’t fly Vistara. They have no courtesy for their passengers, and their staff in HYD is careless, inefficient, incompetent, and ignorant. 

I flew IndiGo 6 times within 3 weeks in India and they were perfect. I would suggest choosing them instead.",International,1.0,February 2023,15 February 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER-  THEY NEVER RESPOND TO EMAILS AND SCAM YOU,Aman K,London - New Delhi,"I travelled with Vistara from London Heathrow to Delhi + Amritsar, India in December 2022.

Firstly I paid for leg room which got cancelled but I never received a refund. When I asked the reception desk at Heathrow and Delhi airport, I was directed to the customer service email. I have sent more than 20 emails in the last month and not a single response. Secondly, their customer service agent (Tara) at check in desk, Terminal 3 fear mongered us about the requirement of a negative covid PCR test/ covid pass at Delhi Airport. To note, at this point India had lifted all these restrictions as per Government guidelines online. Yet she scared me and my family, stressing us before our flight at the airport. I called Vistara customer service and they also said there is a requirement. This was FALSE information, which led to a loss of over £500 for my family as we had to take last minute COVID tests at the airport. On arrival at Delhi airport, there was NO requirement for negative COVID tests/ COVID pass and NO questions about anything related to COVID. I am very disappointed with this airline.

MISSING BAGGAGE FROM VISTARA,Sagar p,Ahmedabad - Edinburgh,"I recently returned to Edinburgh from Ahmedabad, India via London Heathrow airport, which arrived (18/01/2023) at 11:00PM at Edinburgh Airport.

My luggage, which was supposed to be checked all the way through to my final destination, baggage tag No. (5E795161) has apparently been completely miss-placed and possibly off-loaded at London Heathrow Airport. My both bags were missing but fortunately one bag got delivered in 4 days but the bag tag 5E795161 is still missing for 13 days.

The ground staff at the EDINBURGH lost luggage counter wrote down my missing luggage report, where the staff informed me that they would be in touch within (24) hours to inform me of where and when my luggage would be tracked down and arriving. The reference number for the report is EDIBA18246.

It has been 13 days now; I have spoken to your call center numerous times a day since my arrival, and they have absolutely no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage and hear completely different answers in each call!

I find it completely unprofessional how in our world today with the security and technology available to you as a large airline can completely miss-place baggage.

I have certain items inside which are completely irreplaceable. I hope that the bag will be located and sent back as I have my clothes, personal items, valuable items and more but should it never turn up and be reported missing indefinitely, I believe that I am entitled to some form of compensation from the airline.

I am in contact with British Airways and as per their continuous correspondence to me that baggage is already on T3 with Vistara and they are still waiting to receive it at T5.  Can i please have clarity and have the case expedited as its been 2 weeks i have no answer from VIstara.

Staffs at the Check In Counters in Mumbai are Lazy and Cold!,Marquez,Mumbai - Kathmandu,"Two stars is for the seat on premium economy (the only airline in India that have a premium economy for flight Mumbai - Kathmandu) and the smooth flight eventhough it was delayed. Though seats on their premium economy is still small. So where do i begin with my frustration with this airline? Its at the check in counter at Mumbai International Airport. I arrived more than 3 hours before the scheduled flight but was only able to check in 40 minutes or less before the flight. Imagine the hassle of going through the immigration and security check also walking/running through the boarding gate with less time! The reason is the incompetent staff at check in counters as they said they havent found my reservation when its already successfully paid online with my card. They keep me waiting for 2 hours trying to contact their reservations team back and forth even trying to take a photo of my debit card front and back which that alone is illegal. They keep saying wait for 5 minutes, 10 minutes and so on until they keep me hanging on the air and did not entertain me anymore as they have no clue and cant give me an answer. Until around 40 minutes left before the scheduled flight and all the passengers on my flight have already checked in so i was able to talk to the manager and after at least 15 minutes wait she told me that she found my reservation! Are they serious? Not even offering me to fastrack my immigration and security checks with the less time i had. Will i fly again? Yes i will give it a try but this time only domestic flight. We’ll see how it will differ with the first time i flew with them.

Poor quality overall,SanalBabu,New Delhi - Frankfurt,"I recently travelled from New Delhi to Frankfurt in Vistara for the first time. I felt that the overall travel experience was poor and in fact I would rate Vistara as one of the worst international flight I have had.

The food they server on board was not good. They must be trying to tailor the menu to serve the Indian customer. But, I felt that the quality and taste was poor.

I felt that aircraft was a relatively smaller aircraft compared to the other airlines that fly on the same route. The configuration of the aircraft was such that it felt very cramped and felt a bit suffocating. Leg space was also below average.

The entertainment system really needs an overhaul. First of all very few movies/shows to opt from compared to what is offered by other airlines. Even the ones that are available are really out dated. Some really old Hindi movies like the DDLJ. Seriously? No good live flight tracking information.

Did not manage to get any sleep on this flight. There were people playing loud music for their kids on their phone at night when most were trying to get some sleep. The airline staff did not bother to ask them to lower the volume or did not interfere in any way.

They ran out of toilet paper and paper towel in the bathrooms midway and the bathrooms were a mess. Had to decide not to use the bathroom till I landed. It was that bad.

 Had always loved traveling in VISTARA but this experience has destroyed the CONCEPTION OF COURTESY. When food is not offered but thrown on your face.

Unprofessional and Unethical airline,Alice M,Hyderabad - Mumbai,"Hi,

I have travelled HYD-MUM enroute to Toronto on 28th December 2022.

My booking reference is 3QUVWR.

I faced many issues with your airline which are concerning.

1. I had three pieces of excess baggage and I was willing to pay the fee as stated in my ticket document which was CAD 100 per each extra piece ( 23kgs). Your staff at the airport charged me 200 USD per piece. When I asked them to show me a document which states that I must pay 200 USD, they said they donot have any and they cannot provide any supporting document. We were subjected to massive stress at HYD airport. Your staff extorted USD 200 from us without providing us any supporting document. I can provide you an evidence that I have to pay only CAD 100 per each extra piece.

2. We were assigned seats 16A,16B and 16C on HYD-BOM segment by Vistara. On boarding the aircraft, we found that seat belt on seat 16A was installed incorrectly and cannot be used. This was brought to the attention of cabin crew immediately and sought help. However, after few minutes, I was flabbergasted to see that the departure is being commenced without fixing the seat belt which is a safety violation. When I expressed my displeasure,  One cabin crew said that they will look into this after DEMO and another said that that they will look into this after take-off !!!! I was utterly shocked at the handling of  a safety violation issue intentionally thereby subjecting my son to a risk. The seat belt was removed and re-installed by the senior cabin crew while the aircraft was taxing. What a callous attitude towards safety issue of a passenger. How did the departure commenced without fixing the seat ? I tried to speak to the captain of the flight on arrival in Mumbai and asked him if he was aware of the unsafe condition of the pax before he commenced pushback of the aircraft for departure. His silence acknowledged he may be aware of the unsafe condition. This implies that he commenced a departure knowing very well that a pax is not in safe condition which is a serious safety violation putting my son's life/safety at risk intentionally. This also can be treated as an action with criminal intent.",Domestic,2.0,December 2022,2 January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

 Their attitude is like if you don't have a report copy then forget about your baggage. tried all the nos suggested by them, but no help  they are just referring to each other

Stop Cheating Customers,Vikash K,London - Ranchi,"Complain about the refund issue for PNR PRP4GI. I have cancelled the return leg of the journey LHR to IXR.
I was told that the total refund amount will be ~ INR 1,20,000. I checked three times before getting the ticket cancelled and my refund amount was confirmed somewhere around INR 1,20,000.

I got the ticket cancelled and booked my journey.

To my surprise, refund was  ~INR 28,000 far less than what I was told.

When I called the customer service, I was told that the refund was as per the fare rules.

This means the return ticket which cost me INR 1,50,000 per ticket. Ranchi to London price was INR 1,36,000 and the return London to Ranchi price was INR 14,000. Really?

I really want to book a ticket with VISTARA LONDON TO RANCHI IN GBP 142 ~ INR 14000. (liars)

So I was cheated by Air Vistara. Give wrong information and then take advantage of the situation because the money is in your hand.
So I am losing ~ GBP 1000 (~INR 1,00,000) and I paid extra for Flex ticket to have this refund done smoothly. GREAT CHEATING SERVICE.

I was given many reference numbers (14866444, 14816409, 14769757 and some I don't remember as well)

Called regarding this more than 10 times. All I got was sorry, let me put you on hold, will call you back (never received any call) and another reference number when I insisted.

DON’T TRAVEL BY VISTARA,Suprita N,Mumbai - Bengaluru,"If there was an option for zero stars, that’s what I would give Vistara. 

Nope, please do not travel by Vistara. 

We traveled from Mumbai to Bangalore on Dec 9th by Vistara. I was traveling with my mom who is 85 years old. We were on our way to attend my nephew’s wedding. 

We loaded 2 bags first at the check in counter. The Vistara employee was highly inefficient and under trained. He told us that the system is showing the bags are overweight although the 2 bags weighed exactly 30 Kgs. He also told us that the system is showing boarding has already started and he is unable to checkin our bags though we were checking more than 2 hours before the flight departure time. The employee was totally confused and had to get help of fellow employee. The fellow employee hurriedly started helping us. He looked at my carry on bag and mentioned the dimensions are larger than the allowed. 
I gave him the specifications and told him that it is within the allowed dimensions. Since I didn’t want to have any further issues I checked in my carry on bag. I also checked in my mom’s carry on bag. So we had total 4 bags that we checked in 

In the chaos and the rush, I forgot to check if the tags were attached to all 4 bags. I also overlooked the bags tags that were provided to us. 

When we landed in Bangalore, we found out that my mom’s bag was missing. And I realized that I didn’t have the bag tag for this bag. 

We stopped at the Vistara baggage tracking center at the airport and filed a complaint. We did not get a complaint number. Since my mom was not feeling good, we left the airport. 

Until today we have made several calls to Vistara. All the calls have been handled inefficiently by Vistara employees. We can’t get a supervisor or a manager to talk to. 

We are totally disappointed by the way Vistara has handled this. We have requested CCTV footage as that is the only way to track the bag, but Vistara is unable to show us the CCTV footage. My mom could not wear any of the wedding clothes for her grand son’s wedding. 

I request to my fellow passengers to not to travel by Vistara airlines.",Domestic,1.0,December 2022,23 December 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worst Experience,imsha,Muscat Governorate - Mumbai,"Worst experience of my life that I choose VISTSRA Airline on 16th Dec2022  flight UK 234 from Muscat to Mumbai.

My journey start from Muscat Airport, during check-in queue one of  the ground staff was literally lecturing us all like a school teacher as if we all were flying for the 1st time in our life it was not only me who felt this but all who were also in the queue along .Immediatly I realized that I  did a mistake by choosing VISTARA.                                I would advice even if ur not travelling from VISTARS do spare some time at VISTARA check-in counter they will make u feel  that we choose the cheapest Airline not only rate wise even standard wise at Muscat Airport. After landing to mumbai Airport we struggle  alot due to endless immigration queue which is not Vistara Fault.

We had forgotten one of our luggage on the  Belt (number 12),we immediately complained to the  Airport Lost and and found .They in turn asked us to contact the Airline, so we called VISTARA which it self was a pian as no one was receiving the calls  we actully had to struggle for 3days to get an answer, then we called Customer VISTARA again no positive response plus lack of knowledge to help or guide the customer .The only  answer they gave me is please get in touch with the  Airport Lost and found , I peraonally visited the Airport Lost and found they told me to   call VISTARA Airline, then I explain them that VISTARA told me to contact Airport LNF, After lot of struggle I was provided the number of Terminal Manager . I spoke with Terminal Manager he gave me a new story that I should contact the  Customs department for my luggage...Like seriously??? I even tried doing that but no one is receiving the call....

Moral of the above experience not always Cheap is best, some time you have pay more then that.

Happy flying with VISTARA worst Airline ever.

5 enjoyable flights across India,Apolonia70,New Delhi - Leh,"My first flight with Vistara was an introduction to what it is like to sit in a seat at the front of their planes - seat @A for both to Leh and out of.  The boarding process is messy at the airport - mainly because the gates are used by several flights and airlines and announcements are not always clear or audible - very noisy when passengers just rush to check-in.  Sadly, not all airlines have access to walkways and using stairs isn't an easy option for us more mature passengers. Staff were helpful but one, on another Vistara flight, wanted to take my walking stick away. Luckily, he changed his mind and I was able to use it to get up and down the steps as well as walk to the plane. Not every older person has to use a wheelchair.

Vistara - Worst customer experience. International travel. Poor Baggage Policy,Rathna N,Bengaluru - Newark,"Terrible terrible experience Traveling on United reservation  from Bangalore to Newark with connection in Delhi. I had called both United and Vistara to confirm baggage policy.  With PNR number provided Vistada representative  did not provide checkin baggage allowance . I was told they will honor the ticketing airline baggage policy.. Given that I went to the airport with three bags  32 kG, 32kg and 21 kgs, since with Premier 1K status with united, I was allowed 3 checkin bags. Vistara  flight number was your UA7724, which means United policy would apply. At the airport I was told that I am allowed only one checking bag of 23 KG’s.. to carry the other bags I’ll have to pay a ridiculous baggage fee of $1100.  200 (2nd bag)+ 300(additional weight) 300(3rd bag)+300(Additional weight). This was completely unreasonable.. I was cornered, and there was no other option to get around. On vistara’s website, there is no indication of 23 KG weight limit for international flights originating from India. This is very bad policy and lack of information on their website from Vistara. I had to leave my bags behind  as I could not pay the baggage fee. I need those bags in US.  For botched up policy by Vistara, i am requesting them to arrange to send the bags from Bangalore to Newark.",International,1.0,November 2022,12 November 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

While booking last month I realised my Club Vistara account was disabled without notice and I asked it to be reinstated. The team asked me to provide an identity document for which I have shared the scanned copy of my passport. But then they wanted that scan to be self-attested. I have provided a digital self-attested version of the scanned passport. 

Now they are asking for a wet signature self attestation. Which means I have to print on a paper, sign it then scan it and send a digital copy, then throw away the paper copy! I refuse to do this mindless exercise on principle because it is harmful to the environment!

"Meets expectations, but when there are exceptions, Service falls apart.",Sreeni I,Mumbai - Chennai (Madras),"In India recently (live in California) and booked a few flights on Vistara. 

First flight from Mumbai to Chennai was in Economy. Vistara emailed multiple times for upgrade @ 10K Rs. Tried to upgrade online but presented with Errors - reached out to Support (Abhinav Bhaskar, who signs as Sr. Executive - Customer Relations) to describe website problems, who promised to help but did not. Seems that the only thing they are empowered to do is to ""apologize for inconvenience"" without no real empowerment/capability to actually do anything to resolve the problem.

Then given lack of timely support, upgraded at airport, where they could not care less about my online experience only to insist that on-site upgrades at airport were 16K (10K was online only). I reached out to Support again to a> describe the poor user experience and b> seek some recompense, but now they couldn't bother to respond.

Since then had 2 other flights - flew economy - tried to upgrade on one, again met with poor user experience - so opted against it. Since then , never tried to upgrade - so the flights were OK. Hence my review of: you follow the ""happy - path"" - service could meet expectations.

Great trip on a Vistara,shashi b,Hyderabad - Amritsar,"My friends recommended that I use Vistara for the connections and the service. I traveled from Hyderabad to Amritsar with a change of planes at New Delhi.

Service is top class and every passenger gets a meal. On the Hyderabad - Delhi fight the aircraft had screens on the front of the seat. I watched a nice comedy movie. Had hot breakfast.

Changing at Delhi, you go through security again and 1b hour cuts it fine but is doable.

The Delhi Amritsar flight is short , still you get a snack and cookies.

Baggage was very quick.

Return to Hyderabad was great. Even if the flight is delayed, everyone makes an effort to get you to your destination on time.

Due to weather in Delhi, the flight from Amritsar had to be in a holding pattern for a few minutes so my connection was short. There were Vistara ground staff at every place to assist and help.

Due to the short connection and the weather delay, my bag missed the transfer. I got it delivered home the next day. Lesson learned of not to pack medicines in your checked in baggage.

Oh the return flight Delhi - Hyderabad loved the chicken tikka masala with Paratha, fudge brownie ice cream and coffee.

The cabin crew were pleasant on all my flights. They took care of all requests especially for water that seemed frequently asked for. In fact they almost anticipated every need. I loved the Vistara World entertainment and watched Thoda adjust please!

Overall, when I travel in India, I'll choose Vistara. Or maybe they'll be part of Air India.

Never again with the awful Vistara,BLKovalam,Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) - New Delhi,"I have been singing the praises of Vistara since they started operations some years back.  I have flown business with them multiple times.

This time the rates were far to high to justify business and so I booked Premium Economy for my Trivandrum – Delhi flight of three hours.

A month before departure they changed the flight number and timings. The next day they downgraded me to economy.

They suggested that I call them for options.  The first call was cut off after 18 minutes and the second call lasted 26 minutes. This was 44 minutes wasted.

My options were to have a refund or fly in economy.  They would not give me the original baggage allowance of 25kg if I did. They would compensate me just over US $15 for the downgrade. Pathetic.

This kind of customer service is despicable.

I rebooked with Air India in their business class although the cost was more than double.

I have two other flights booked with Vistara and if they do not downgrade me again, I have little choice but to fly with them on those flights.

After this, never again.  I will not deal with a business that treats customers with such contempt and simply does not care. How can any business go from superb to appalling in such a short time?

Of course instead of telling everyone to fly with Vistara, I will be telling everyone not to. What a disgraceful way to deal with people.",Domestic,1.0,October 2022,11 October 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Below Average Business Class,nikunj s,New Delhi - London,"I took a business class flight to London in May from Delhi. Right from the onset the service was extremely disappointing. 

Firstly, they advertised that the business class customers get free wi-fi on board. With some important emails pending which I was supposed to pick up on-board, I was left shocked as the aircraft did not have any wi-fi. Surprisingly, there was no apologies by Vistara either. I am a platinum member. 

Secondly, as a business class customer, for the first time I did not get the food of my choice despite pre-booking it. By the time I was served, the chicken options were over. They tried compensating by arranging an equivalent from premium economy, but they ran out of food there as well. I was left with a only one food option, which was my last preference. Again, the staff was very casual about it. 

Thirdly, the seats are not the most comfortable for full recline. You end up stretching your legs in the rear portion of the seat in front of you, as a result there is little room to move the legs while lying down. 

Lastly, there is no concept of priority. At Heathrow we had to wait 2.5 hours at immigration despite flying business. 

I have never had such an awful experience with the business class of any other airlines, where in particular the staff is very friendly and is always looking to go above and beyond to ensure best service. In Vistara, neither was the staff apologetic, nor did they reach out afterwards to amend the situation despite leaving a terrible on-board feedback.

SCAM Airline. Worst service. Unprofessional employees.,Gopal G,Mumbai - Chicago,"I recently flew to U.S. with United with Vistara as local flight operator in India. As per my booking, there were two bags allowed. I had confirmed this with United Airlines beforehand. I had also confirmed this with Vistara Airlines. As per the airlines' representative, there were two bags allowed by due to some internal agreement between United and Vistara.

Case 1: When my mom showed up to the Vistara counter at Mumbai Airport, the representative told her she could not carry two check-in bags. She couldn't speak Hindi or English. The Vistara employees argued for an hour. I called the airlines, ticket seller and everyone I could right at that time. Apparently they asked their manager and came to a conclusion that two bags were allowed as per the agreement I stated above. My question is, was all of this harassment really necesarry? Where was the manager before? Are the employees not doing their duties? Do they not know such simple things? 

Case 2: After the above incident, I called Vistara and United again. They AGAIN confirmed that two bags were allowed. This time, my dad was flying the same route with same airlines. And the Vistara crew did the same thing again. He was told again to pay for 2nd bag. This time Vistara employees claimed that this issue with the bags is active in the Airlines and the management is aware of it. However, there are not willing to resolve it. I mean, seriously? WTH! What kind of service is it? My dad explained everything he could to Vistara and also paid 16,XXX rupees extra for 2nd bag even though it was confirmed he could carry it. I should have recorded my call with this unprofessional airline and its crew. I am following up on this and there has been no resolution from Vistara. I also reached out to United Airline and they said there was no such charge from them and I should contact Vistara since they are the once who charged me!!! Why Vistara? I need my refund for the bag. And at this point I have gone through so much trouble; I am definetly going to keep following and posting updates and recording of call and proof of this.

"Made us unhealthy, stressed and breathless due to carelessness of ground staff and insulting behaviour of Canbin CrewK-8",BhautikVVaidya,Hyderabad - Mumbai,"We had a day tour from Mumbai to Hyderabad and return on same day. Our morning flight form Mumbai had an excellent feel of usual services of Tata's Airline, but Hyderabad to Mumbai flight at night made our experience extremely worst. My 79 yrs. age mother and my self-suffered a lot with breathless stress to board the flight after a full day busy travel to a temple darshan. 
Even though we had confirmed wheel chair booking and email from Vistara confirming that we can use our own wheel chair, Hyderabad ground staff insisted to use their wheel chair and check-in our wheel chair as luggage. We took no objection, though in morning Mumbai staff allowed to use our own wheelchair up to flight cabin. Unfortunately, after dropping us at Plaza Lounge at about 7.30pm, no one came to pick us for boarding till about 9.20pm though as per boarding pass time of boarding was 8.35pm. I tried contacting various sources to get the wheel chair and reach gate. With all failures, somehow, I found some wheel chair at lounge and rushed to Gate 18 where I saw the red warning display ""FINAL CALL"". Flight door was about to close. I think we were the last pax to report. Somehow managed to board after great difficulties and then misbehaviour of Inflight Supervisor in front of other pax in cabin made me really feel insulted. While disembarking coincidently Captain came out of the cockpit and I thought of reporting the misbehaviour and her reaction was like ""he is one of our very good staff"" (as if I was the very bad person to report the bitter truth!). Seeing me reporting the truth, other paxs also started telling the truth of Vistara staff's poor services. So, Captain and Inflight Supervisor hided themselves inside the cabin.
Subsequently, when we reached Mumbai and got our own wheelchair the ground staff insisted to carry the wheelchair up to cab. And I was kept busy on call with their Customer Service on mobile and a shift in charge near belt was talking to my mother. Therefore, I could not check the condition of our wheelchair. When I reached home and carried it from ground floor to home, I found it's left side break is damaged. Of course, they will say it was not reported at airport, so they are not responsible.
The calls with Vistara team at midnight was disconnected (unable to digest the bitter truth because their Hyderabad ground staff and Cebine crew will of course not accept their own mistakes to protect their own jobs!) informally (near to similarity of the informal behaviour of crew inside cabin).

Worst experience with Vistara Staff at New Delhi,Venkat Sadhu,New Delhi - Hyderabad,"I’m not writing this with Frustration, but also trying to help other people. I had booking from New Delhi to Hyderabad by Vistar morning flight at 7:20 Pm.  I along with my family reached airport terminal exactly at 6:30am after lot of hurdles with crowd at entrance gate of airport entry. Custard staff intentionally didn’t allowed me for boarding of flight even though I have had 40minutes of time before flight departure. I requested multiple Vistara employees including Duty manager(a lady) saying that I reached 40 minutes prior and didn’t had any check in baggage. But still didn’t allowed me and charged much expensive rescheduling charges for 4 passengers. Unfortunately system didn’t allowed me web check in from 5:30 am of same day. 

The intention of Vistara employees was clear that they have to charge passengers extra money… looks like that was the goal set by company. 

This is ridiculous situation that I have paid extra money to reschedule another flight at 10:20Am for 4 passengers( my family) and actually boarding of this flight started at 10;00 Am ( which was like 20 minutes  prior to scheduled departure time). If they would have considered the same for my morning flight I would have been saved lot of money as well as my time.

Best Indian Airline So Far,SolivagantWolf,Dubai - Bengaluru,"Vistara Airway's
Flight UK202 DXB BOM 
Flight UK845 BOM BLR
Dubai Airport while check In ground staff huddled all the passengers in Economy CheckIn Lane even though there was a Drop Bag lane. After standing for 10 mins I spoke with him an asked why do Web checkIn need to stand here and not at Drop Bag Lane, then knowing that i had done Web checkIn he asked me to stand in that lane. So the staff need to guide the passengers the rightway from the first instance so that inconvenience is not caused later. 
The check in and boarding was smooth.  In flight well need to improve your Inflight Entertainment. There was no English Music content for the passengers to listen to. I personally don't listen to Hindi music. Movies could be updated also. 
Inflight meal its OK nothing that fancy
Service well it's different thing some passengers were offered wet towels and water some weren't? Very strange
I had to ask for water.

We asked her again that are you sure that we will receive our baggage in YYZ Pearson International Airport? And she again said yes. So we reminded her again that the layover is more than 5 hours at Delhi and she needs to reconfirm as she could be a new staff and don't know.

I arrived at Del airport at 12 am via UK950 on 4th Sep and realized one of my baggage is missing... When the staff checked,  they said 4 baggage said the destination as Delhi but one of the bags said destination as Delhi. 
So they can't help us, they did not take any complaint or take our complaint number. I am still at the airport for more than 2 and half hour.

The baggage handling, flight arrivals (they always seem to rush boarding, but end-up arriving late). Boarding experience has been horrible (especially Delhi, just like AirIndia). ‘Not sure why Vistara does immigration checks for transit passengers (middle of journey), while respective govt. authorities does this any way! They do not show this level of attention while doing transfers on arrival! You are left on your own. Boarding is a chaos always….not sure what they mean by Priority Service (chauffeur more as business tactic!!) invariably serving food in flight is late (may be similar to BA flights)! Cabin temperature is poor (always warm). While they price it slightly competitive to players like emirates, there service quality is like AirIndia and BA. Not recommended, not value for money.

We were told at Delhi airport that it was missed by Vistara at London.  It’s been 25 days and there is no news of the baggage. I have called Vistara’s customer care, airport staff, and other staff members more than 100 times but I have got no response. Vistara’s customer care team has mentioned that they have no answers for me and that I have to contact via email through custrelations, only to find out the the replies on email are standard bot replies and the staff is unable to answer very simple questions, such as, after how many days of searching does Vistara declare a bag as lost, what is the claim policy of Vistara, etc. I also posted several tweets on Twitter but got standard bot replies from Vistara.  As one can understand, I am extremely annoyed and been almost tortured by the Vistara staff and their responses. Their clueless unprofessional staff adds to the tormentation by the airline and cause unmeasurable amount of trouble to the passenger. It is almost appearing to me that I did my life’s biggest mistake by choosing Vistara, clearly the worst airline of the decade.  As of today, I still don’t have any clue about my bag and Vistara staff is as clueless as anything.   I request Indians to abandon Vistara in both domestic and international sectors.

Very bad experience with vistara airline,Tek Cand,Chandigarh - New Delhi,"Iam writing my experience with vistara airline almost a month  late.

Ground experience

16th July2022. Sunny day and im traveling with vistara airline UK638 from Chandigarh to Delhi. I was very much excited. Usually i use to travel in Indigo but this time Vistara. That's excitement doesn't last for long time, sad news comes at checking counter Ms. SHEETAL  ( counter staff) informed me that my luggage weight (38Kg) are crossed the allowed limit which is 15kg but I travel international on my international flight allowed limit was 40kg .  I know that  since I use to travel international alot. Because of my work as im seamen. So I requested Ms sheetal try no to charge me if she has an authority if not then call her supervisor.  Mr. PIYUSH  (counter controller) comes in picture same thing was informed to him also but he also couldn't able to help me and told me I need to pay INR800 for extra luggage weight. I requested him also to call their manger hoping he could help me out.  So MS.DIVYA (counter supervisor) same thing was informed to her also I was hoping she has more authority and she can able to help me out. Big disappointed come as she also said, I need to pay for extra luggage weight (INR 800). That time I really started missing INDIGO AIRLINES I never face such situation, their indigo staff at checking counter has full authority and they happy to help international travel and seamens even IF I HAVE TWO PNR TICKET NUMBERS THEY ALWAYS  TAKE THE 2nd REFERENCE PNR NUMBER OF MY INTERNATIONAL  FLIGHT AND THEY DO NOT CHARGE ME FOR MY EXTRA  LUGGAGE.  Seeing no options left with me I have decided to pay 800 INR. And have over the cash to Ms Sheetal after a min she returned my money I was surprised hoping something good is happening and started getting positive finally they will help me. But this time big bomb explode now I have to pay more 1500 INR. Ms. Diya trying to explain me why I need to pay more  this made me so much disappointed .I still required help if any other high ranking manager can help please call him. MR. YASIR KHAN  (Duty manager) hoping he can help me  guess what he stick with company policies  no flexibility pay means pay. No other option and the staff will not going to help me. I pay the amount of 1500 INR. I asked all team members names who are involved in my case they had given me their name and said to me ""IT WILL NO  GOING TO HELP YOU""( words from Mr.piyush). In reply I said  “I know it will not going to help me but I can share my experience online and other social media ”. When I started inquiry about the flight in detail  then Ms. Sheetal said “YOU CAN CHECK ONLINE” and ask his fellow team member to in charge I can feel she was not happy to serve as im hard traveler to handle. I didn’t  have much interaction with  Mr. Khan  but I can hear him at my back he is tell his team member  that he will  going to pay just leave him alone for a while. All I’m asking for help since i am traveling long and need to change 3 more international flights to reach my final destination. I my own home and our own Indian flight are not helping me what best I can expect. That time I decide to bring this type of issues and send feed back company and post my story on other social media so that  No other fellow international traveler face such problems

INSIDE FLIGHT
It is short flight from chandigarh to Delhi.  flight is neat and clean, simily face of crew and in short time they served snake. Good for domestic traveler.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO FELLOW INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS AND SEAMENS.
Kindly avoid vistara airline if you are traveling with luggage weight more than 15kg. Ground staff will not help you or check with airline before booking your tickets if they can help you or not.

SUGGESTIONS TO COMPANY 
1)Please help and flexible with internatioal travelers and seamens 
2)Kindly review such issues and be flexible in baggage guidelines for international travelers and give more authority to staff at counter. To avoid blockage at checking counter. 
3)In my point of view training are required for  ground staff members what type of phrases to be use. try to avoid phrases like ""IT WILL NOT GOING TO HELP YOU"".

I was an international passenger traveling from Chennai to Delhi to Amsterdam to Boston in July 2022. Chennai to Delhi segment was in Vistara. Checked bag at Chennai with intention of collecting it at Delhi for additional shopping at the airport. Come to baggage claim, bag is missing, waited for an hour, still no bag, went to Vistara customer service desk, they called a few people, weren’t able to trace it. The agent took my complaint, filed a Property Irregularity Report (I have the file reference number and picture of the signed report), told me not to worry, the bag will be located and I will be receiving it in the States within a couple of days. As of today it is about 2 weeks since the incident happened. In the meantime my family in India and I have been trying to get info from customer service, but nothing

We even wrote to the Nodal Office Bhatia requesting his office to investigate, still nothing happened. I am completely frustrated by the whole experience that I am exploring my next options.

Montreal Convention from 2003 gives passengers certain rights in such circumstances, including financial compensation from the airline that I am looking for filing the claim. That process too I found is not straight forward. There is no information on Vistara website about this. Perhaps they do it intentionally, in order to make life even more difficult for the passengers.

I booked international flight directly via Air Vistara Website. They provided me an option of the connecting flight with their partner airline.

One of the connections with partner airlines was delayed and hence I missed Air Vistara connecting flight. Air Vistara class this as ""no show"" and won't refund anything. If the entire journey was booked from their website, via one ticket reference number and via chosen connection partner of Air Vistara, how can they not acknowledge the delay and deny refund and rebooking?
Don't trust this airline a bit as their customer service is not in existence and people on the calls just give the answers they suit. There is no standard policy, process .

﻿Hi,

I write to commend your staff on an exceptional level of service when I traveled with your airline on the above date.The service i had was a superb experience throughout the flight on one specific segment. The service was truly flawless.In particular, the following cabin crew provided exceptional service.

Starting from my checking at the Bangalore airport I would like to say thanks to Miss Harshita who really helped me for my boarding pass printout and luggage assistance. She was humble and very sweet! I can say that her assistance made me feel to share my experience. 

A big clap for all the Security employees at the airport! 

Comes to welcome part on flight. I was welcomed by Miss Monica, she was extremely courteous & professional in her approach right from welcoming onboard & ensuring that the entire journey was as seamless as possible. Miss Printi was proactive in providing assistance during the entire journey. Her assistance was very  proactively and helpful.
 Sad part - I have checked with Miss Tanya might be Senior crew (during sign belt on ) to use laboratory as I was not feeling well,she told me she will check with the caption and then allowed, and I was waited till the time I see people are easily going and no one saying anything to them! I was waited and we need to follow safety and for our security purpose few things however she never came back to me! That was a sad part because customers trust you on guys! Might be she is senior crew so not boughter for a request anyhow rest all crew were very kind. 

I trust that you will pass on this recognition to the specific staff members from this flight. They are a true reflection of the high levels of standard that we have come to expect of Vistara Airlines.

Worst Checkin and Customer Relations - Vistara,Biju Nambisan,Kochi (Cochin) - Dallas,"Hello, I had one of the worst checkin experience on two counts 
1. The staff is very rude and the checkin lady by name Kripa had no basic understanding on how code share works on an International Ticket. She didnt even want to listen and check the ticketed details and was already decided on charging extra for cabin baggage against an allowance of 12 KG for international ticket. They insisted on limits being 7KG and one can imagine that it isnt possible to adjust this kind of wright limit at the last moment. AIR VISTARA DOESNT HONOUR CODE SHARE AGREEMENTS PERIOD. It was one of the worst chekcin experience and they randomly charged 150 USD against  the policy of 100 USD even if it was extra baggage. So they seem to be working on whims and fancies of their own staff and have no rules. Additionally the appellate authority doesn't even want to listen and is advising to contact Air France. I think you should be careful in using Vistara locally.  Very disappointed and agonizing experience. BR Biju",International,3.0,July 2022,24 July 2022,3.0,N/A,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"Good Service, rich legroom but limited connectivity within India",Andy_61,Mumbai - Chennai (Madras),"Vistara was a new experience after numerous flights with Indigo.

Horrid airport experience,LMM,New Delhi - Srinagar,"I booked a flight online for my boyfriend on Vistara. I am a seasoned traveller and know the rules, so because I would not be travelling with him, I gave him a photocopy of my credit card and a photocopy of my ID both attested by me (the card holder) as per Vistara policy (indicated on their website). But when he tried to check-in for his flight at the Delhi airport, they said his ticket was suspended. They didn't care that he had the correct document (the photocopy of my credit card). 
So he ended up calling me on my mobile and he told me they wanted me to call the Customer Service number. I called the Customer Service number and the agent said the computer was showing him as a ""no-show."" 
I said, ""How could he be a 'no-show' when he is at the airport right now???"" So then she put me on hold and came back and said that he needed to show the physical credit card that was used to purchase the ticket. I told her that's not what the Vistara website says and I read her the policy straight from the website. She then asked me the web address, so I told her. (Unbelievable that Customer Service does not know their own policy, which, incidentally, is the same policy as Indigo and Air India.) I guess she read it and learned something because she then said his ticket was no longer suspended. I thought she ""unsuspended"" the ticket in the computer, so with relief I called back my boyfriend at the airport and told him that everything was resolved. But then to my horror he said the check-in agents still wouldn't let him check in. Now, they said, he had to go to the Reservation Desk at the airport! Also, the check-in agents refused to speak with me to verify the ticket or explain what Customer Service said. 
Now, I'm not sure if my boyfriend found somebody helpful, or if something showed up on the computer, because they finally allowed him to check-in. But they had been giving him the runaround for close to two hours, so he said there was no way he was going to get through the large security line and make his flight, which was leaving in 45 minutes. Luckily an intelligent and customer-oriented Vistara agent finally took charge of the situation and escorted him through security, and he made his flight just in the nick of time. But I am still dumbfounded at the incompetence and ignorance of these Vistara check-in agents at the Delhi airport. The inconvenience and stress they put us through was unwarranted and absurd.",Domestic,1.0,July 2022,19 July 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A
Delayed Baggage,Suryansh,London - New Delhi,"I am writing this review to voice out my experience and issues incurred during my first ever journey with Air Vistara. I travelled from Heathrow airport, London to New Delhi airport on the 12th of January. My flight was delayed for more than an hour and when I reached the airport my check-in baggage never arrived at the belt. After inquiring for half an hour at the airport I was able to find the person I could share my concern with. The person told me my baggage hadn't arrived on the flight today and will arrive tomorrow on another flight. I can understand the issue but in all of this situation, I lost my connecting travel to home (another city) which was planned according to the average time airport procedures usually take. Additionally, I was assured that my baggage will be delivered to my home within the next 24hrs which also didn't happen. I did not receive any reference number to even track my baggage and I was just given a photograph of the document I filled out at the airport. Today is the 19th of July (7 days) and I haven't received my baggage yet. I have important documents in the bag and some other necessary things for the work I need to do urgently in India but I do not have access to them as well. I don't know if this is how generally the delayed baggage situation is handled by Vistara, I had a quite good image of the airline, hence I booked with them. This experience has caused some real damage to the plans and scheduled tasks I had and I am feeling highly disappointed with this. 
I sought the airline's support before putting it in the public domain but no help was received even after writing to five different email addresses multiple times, calling the customer care services, and reaching out to the numbers given at the airport. I really wish that nothing like this ever happen to someone. Please be cautious before making the selection of your next airline for travel. I have no hope of receiving my baggage and going to seek legal action for the loss of Money, Time and Effort during this whole travel.",International,4.0,July 2022,18 July 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0
BOM to BLR,Aditya N,Mumbai - Bengaluru,"I took an evening flight from Mumbai to Bangalore last night, and I had an incredible experience on the 90 minute journey. Check-in at Mumbai was excellent—it took me not more than 5 minutes to drop my bags and collect my boarding passes. Boarding was timely and we left on time. The seats on flight were very comfortable. Entertainment was also quite good for a domestic (considering many budget airlines don’t have much of an entertainment platform). All we had to do is connect to the on-flight Wi-Fi and go to the entertainment website. They had multiple TV shows and movies, and also had a flight tracker. The most impressive part of my journey was the meal service, where we received a standard dinner with options in chicken and vegetarian. In all my domestic travels, Vistara was the first domestic flight to offer dinner service instead of a basic snack and drink.

I am a British citizen, and I invited my sister to visit me. My sister provided all the relevant documents to British Council and got visa to visit me. Unfortunately, she decided to book Vistara airline flight to come to London. She was embarrassed and treated like a fraud traveller by your member of staff at Delhi airport today.
 
My sister was travelling on her own and felt very embarrassed by the way she was grilled by your member of staff before issuing a boarding pass. Your staff member was scratching visa sticker with his fingernail on her passport believing it was a fake visa, then he was asking who was she going see in London? He not only stooped there he also asked my sister to prove she was going to see her brother in London. My sister was made to wait at the counter for about 15 minutes before he issued boarding pass. She was asked to make phone call to London to get my London address proof and proof of my relationship with her as brother.
 
Please tell me when airline staff have been asked to behave like a police officer or immigration officer.

Having left with no option, I got myself booked in the early morning flight and had to bear additional cost of stay at the destination. Though airline apologised for the inconvenience, it is of no value to the passenger as he is suffering the loss.

Worst Experience Ever - Never Flying with these thugs again,anshuman,New Delhi - Mumbai,Was flying from New Delhi to Mumbai alongwith my wife and 8 year old kid. Was asked by a ground staff member to stand in the priority queue for folks with infants and elderly instead of the normal queue.

I could see multiple Vistara folks just joking and hanging about instead of paying attention to the jammed priority queue - asked twice for help but to no avail.

He asked for my name roguishly and my kid started crying.

Will not be using this airline ever again.,Mrs Kaur,London - Amritsar,"I have many issues with this airline. Travelled with my husband and 10 month baby. 

1. Selected economy flexi for the outbound flight and economy value for the inbound flight. 
Economy flexi included no extra charge for changing date (for more money) of outbound flight which was perfect as our plans for outbound date were not concrete and may need to travel earlier. 

Indeed we needed to change the flight date, was informed by email there would be charges as the “most restrictive rules apply” which means as I selected econemy value for the inbound flight, the rules were based on this ticket despite pay exta money for three people for the economy flexi! Therefor this airline advertises services for more money that is not given to customer when requested because in there FAQ it states quite slyly the rules - but not at the time of booking! I paid more money for a service that was not provided as when I contacted to change to earlier date I was told I had to pay approx £400 to change the dates for the three of us. 

2. It was my first time travelling with a baby on a long haul journey. I emailed customer services to ensure I understood rules around liquids as my baby drank 260mls of formula milk three times a day - over the limit as liquids can only be carried in 100mls. 

I was advised that I could not carry liquid more than 100ml in bottle and had to buy premade formula bottles of 100 ml to ensure my child didn’t go hungry and cry. When got to air port it was clearly stated that baby milk could be carried in more quantity. 

The emails I received from customer service were not sympathetic. The only thing this airline cares about is making conning money from customers. 

3. I was receiving contradicting information from reps about how much baggage was allowed as It was not clear on the ticket. It was confusing as econemy flexi  allowed more than economy value. In the end I opted to take less baggage as I knew it was another way of conning me for extra money. 

4. E-tickets for individual family members for same booking reference provided rather than one e-ticket with all family member names. This is not environmentally friendly. My 10 month old baby does not need her only e-ticket. 

5. Air vistara do not send an itemised receipt for what had been paid for. Instead send amount paid in total on the e-ticket without the different fares paid for! 

There are other issues I had with being told wrong information regarding stroller for baby and baggage transfer. So many issues and probably haven’t remembered them all. 

As a mother on maternity leave I’ve paid a lot of money for a service I did not receive. I have lost out on money which I can use for my 10 month old baby and towards her quality of life. This airline trades under UK Laws and this is illegal.  

I have emailed custrelations@airvistara.com as suggested by the reps as I am unhappy and want the difference between economy flexi and value on the day of booking refunded back to me.  I have not received a reply. 

My original email was sent on 6th May. Automated email was sent to say I’ll receive a reply within 3-5 working days. 
I forwarded the email to them again on 17th May requesting confirmation that they received the email. I have not yet heard from them. I have forwarded the same complaint email 5 more times today and will give them a further 5 working days to respond and act. If I do not here anything I will be escalating complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regarding The Operation of Air Services (Pricing etc) Regulations 2013 regarding Consumer Protection. 

Below are pictures of some of the emails with contradicting information from the reps and e-ticket with no mention of type of fare paid for.

a fraud company with no morals....,Puneet T,London - New Delhi,"I took business class 2-3 times in last 6 months on Vistara from London to Delhi. i then joined Club vistara and parking my points earned. however, they opend a fake account on my name and moved my points to there without my knowledge.

when after chasing them, they suspended my entire original account so all my points cannot be accesed. after 2 months of chasing they demanded origial boarding pass? i emailed them and they stopped replying.

i want to want all passengers flying on vistara. pls don't get into their club cv points as its a big scam they steal points and pass to their friends and family so they can enjoy benefits.

i will never fly them again. they are a fraud company. a black spot on TATA group which is known for good work.

Best Hospitality #Vistara,Pankaj Singh,Goa - New Delhi,"#Vistara This is the best airline I have ever been on, Fortunately, had the BEST flight attendant #Ishika who was utmost professional, friendly, and kind. I had the regular amount of interaction with her as with any attendant, but in every interaction, she was always helpful and kind. I also wanted to mention all her team members name as the group of crew members today was really awesome, Akriti, Anketa, Madhulika & Kimneihoi. There was plenty of leg space and the seats were very comfortable. It was also very clean, and the food was amazing. Really loved Vistara, I have travelled with many airlines but Vistara is one of my favourite now. Everything was perfect !!

Terrible customer service,Shan B,London - New Delhi,We are about to fly to Delhi and just realised there was a silly mistake during booking that I forgot to put my maiden name which is on the passport.

Making a meaningful difference,har25sh,Chennai (Madras) - New Delhi,"At a time when carriers like Indigo are trying to exploit customers by levying compulsory charges for online seat selection and charging steeply for the average in flight meals, Vistara is truly creating a delightful impact.

1. You can select the seat of your choice for free during booking (Half the seats are free of charge (including Window seats) and they're pretty good)
2. You don't have to pre-book/pay for the meals and they taste just great & there's no compromise on the quantity/quality because it is given for free
3. There's inflight entertainment with engaging content to watch and you are given complimentary earphones.

At the airport, they declined to help and they said flight is closed. We had 40 minutes. And the flight staff refused to help with the boarding pass issue or let us board the flight.

And they could have taken us to the flight but they instead spent 30 minutes telling us that they cannot generate a boarding pass and asking them to accompany and atleast help us board the flight was also no. The simple thing that is not understandable here is that flights are delayed and stopped for all kinds of famous people but for normal citizens like us, this is the behaviour. They pushed us to one person after another saying the same thing. And if they would have given us a boarding pass, in the start, wel would have ran to our gate within 7-10minutes.

"worst worst service , deserve zero star",Rahul,New Delhi - New York City,"I am disappointed to say that I was not allowed to board the flight yesterday at Delhi airport with Vistara Airlines. The booking reference is 4ZITB9.
I was supposed to travel to the US via Frankfurt, to which the staff member of Vistara refused to board saying that the TRANSIT VISA is required. I showed them my valid US visitor visa and Canadian PR card and all the other required Covid-19 documents, but the staff members refused to listen and kept on asking for a transit visa which was not needed in my case according to the law. I came back home disheartened and started checking on Vistara website travel instructions and German govt website thoroughly and  it clearly mentioned that Canada PR holders and the US visa holder do not need a transit visa and I couldn’t find anything that should stop me from boarding the plane. Then I decided to talk to Vistara customer  care representatives. I talked to them for about 3 hours and my matter was still not resolved. 
On call with the first agent, she said that I should have booked my tickets with Vistara airline itself instead of booking it with a third party agent. And when I requested her to show the rule for transit visa she failed to provide it. And when I requested her to connect me to the supervisor, she disconnected the call.
I called again, on call with the second agent, she understood my problem and she herself knew that I shouldn’t be denied boarding pass, and when she further digged in she found that my baggage contained some hazardous material, hence denied boarding, which is not true because my bags were not checked in the first place.
I was denied boarding because I was found carrying harzardous material in bags. It totally swept floor out of my feet. I was shocked to know that I was fooled at the time of boarding. So to assist me further she connected me to the supervisor.
Finally on call with the Supervisior, I was told that I was carrying all the right documentation for travelling, and also I was not required a transit visa. The supervisor asked me to raise a complaint to the Vistara website email and asked me to patiently wait for 24-48 hours for the revert. 
I am hoping that Vistara Airline will refund because it’s a huge mistake from their end which caused me inconvenience and lose of money and time.

Further, my new branded American tourister baggage was damaged, there were too many scratches and they tried to open it to steal valuable things by breaking the zip, how ever they couldn’t succeed. 
At the airport, their staff asked me to write a mail to the customer care, and they would do the needful within 7 to 10 days. 
I wrote a mail to the customer service, but there is no response and it’s been more than 1 and a half month.

Mr Maniar,Gaz Maniar,Ahmedabad - London,Vistara are the worst airline in handling luggage. I flew from Ahmedabad to Dehli on the 08.02.22 and then connection flight to Heathrow. Firstly the flight was late landing following the two cases took over 40 minutes and one of them was broken for which I reported at the luggage office. So far in over 10 days nothing has happened. Secondly the other two suit cases took a further hour and half. I travel many countries but this flight from India to London was the worst in cleansiness of toilets etc and the worst airline for luggage handling. I am still waiting for their customer services to contact me when I have already emailed them. Rubbish service.,International,2.0,February 2022,19 February 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Extremely good service,Iftekhar K,Patna - Chennai (Madras),"Today for the first time i travel by vistara airline . I booked the ticket as ticket charge was almost equal to other flight . I was really impressed by the food they served which was catered by TAJ . When i asked for food charges, i came to know that it was booked with the ticket amount . The flight cleanliness was very good. Staf response was good.

Improve Customer Service,DivakarP17,New Delhi - Varanasi,"As the customer service of Vistara is so bad that I have to write this review. Tata's should try to retain the same quality of customer service when dealing with e-mail and telephone queries as Air India. I can only relate my personal experience in dealing with Air India and Vistara. I have received replies to e-mails that I wrote to Air India whereas even after putting in a complaint to the Nodal Office of Vistara my original request has not been answered. The response time for attendance on phone on Air India is much better than Vistara. If this is the standard that Tata's will provide for customer service, then passengers will be at a great loss when things go wrong for them.

Besides, Vistara provides no further routes to management team ups the likes of Vinod Kannan, who can make the changes to the operation. The only channel left for me is to go through various review sites.",Domestic,1.0,December 2021,9 February 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
Continues to be disappointing,JD,Kolkata (Calcutta) - New Delhi,"The airlines claims to be Indias best, and on a per mile basis business class tickets are as expensive or more than compatible flights in Europe or USA. The onboard experience is okay. But everything before stepping in and after stepping out of the flight is nightmare. 

First of all, no clear announcement of how long the delay is or status at boarding gate. Secondly the gate changed 4 times from one end of the airport to the other - leading to substantial difficulty for elderly passengers as I have noticed. Thirdly, the finally allocated gate number on the board was incorrect - leading to people rushing from gate to gate at the last moment. Lastly, onboarding is a chaos - no group or line - it’s like an open street market.  Somehow the airlines absolves all responsibility of passenger experience outside the door of the aircraft. 

On arrival, experience continues - no gate was assigned and it off-boarded the passengers in the middle of the airport, and elderly passengers struggled to carry their handbags over a stairway bridge to the bus downstairs- which btw is loaded to the full capacity with people next to each other in the middle of the peak of omicron!

To date, I haven't received any communication nor my refund of 62,710 from Vistara. Their websites and apps are not working, (which I have complained several times but to no avail also), and despite repeatedly calling them since the day with a minimum hold time of at least half an hour, the customer care keeps on dilly-dallying the matter by saying the refund is delayed due to covid and will come in 7 days- Despite 10 days being passed (the ticket was canceled on 6th January 2022) and yet there is no communication or news of refund from them. 

I have even written several emails to them which they are obligated to reply to within 48 hours but I am yet to receive any phone call or communication from them. 

I tried speaking to the customer care today also - first time I held the phone for 40 minutes and had to hang up in frustration and second time finally when I got through a customer care executive, he again promised me a call back in 15 minutes and my refund to be issued within today's date.

Good with minimal  issues,TrueIndian,New Delhi - London,"Check in for business class is quick at both Delhi and London Heathrow. 
Three bags of 32 kg each are allowed as check in baggage.
Lounge at Delhi airport is situated at level 4 approached by an elevator from the ground level. This is called Plaza Premium Lounge at level 4.
Lounge at London Heathrow is a shared lounge and is situated at level 2 section F  approached from the duty free area.
The food spread in both the lounges is minimal. London lounge served Indian curries and rice also.
Bar is well stocked at both places.
Sanitizers are available and the wait staff is using masks.
The business cabin has seven rows of four seats each.
In odd number seats, the passengers on either side sit close to each other and so is suitable for couples travelling together. There is a screen between the passengers for privacy which can be lowered. In even number seats there is a distance between both the passengers.
All the window seats are single.
The entry to odd numbered seats is very narrow and the lower part of the body is compressed considerably when you enter your seat.
The seats are cushioned but have only a recline and flat bed option. No in seat massager.
Socks, eye pad, sanitizer bottle, face screen, surgical mask, blanket, and a headphone is provided.
There is a table top for storage and a small shelf with a door too for storage.
Phone charger is available by the seat.
Reading lights are good and positioned well.
Complimentary WiFi was available throughout the flight between take off and landing and had good speed.
Big screen TV with good basket of programs .
The overhead bins were placed quite high and so they have provided a slot in the seat on which one has to climb to use the bins comfortably in case you are of average height. But the crew always came for help when they saw you using the overhead bin.
Sleep quality was good and cabin noise was moderate.

RACIST CABIN ATTENDENT ON BOARD WHO PREFER WHITE SKIN PAX,Kevin k,London - New Delhi,"Myself a foreign national took advantage of the visa issued by Indian Govt for tourism and i was happy to come to India and admire the best country that i always admired, until i had to face the following issue on AIR VISTARA after which spoiled my plans for further joyful moment that i was supposed to be spending in 10 days trip to india, because of the below trauma: 

The following i did complaint to AIR VISTARA ON 17 November at 2pm IST, itself and air vistara has till date not come back to me to even discuss the issue, i was calling them numerous times daily 10 times a day and i was kept on hold  for hours saying that supervisor will be available soon to talk to me, and every time i call they only say supervisor will call me within 12 hours and still no one turns back to even call back

Kindly see the below case:

On 16 Nov dep LHR for Delhi I was seated on seat 42H, and a white skin British women was seating on 42 I, when the meals was served the cabin attended went straight to 42I to the white lady and she asked her what meal preference non veg or veg, the white lady seated on 42I replied non veg and she was served non veg and when the flight attended said to me we only have veg sorry we don’t have non veg and then I said why she asked the white lady first when I should have been asked first as my seat is 42H she had no answer she said we need to pre book meals online, then I connected to free wifi on board n opened my booking and showed her the flight attendant and also the supervisor Miss Alvina some name she told , that meals selection is only showing two options in drop down one is No Preference and other is fruit platter, CA said boarding passes show the meal selection so i requested to show me the boarding pass of the white lady just to see the pass or non veg meal is stamped on it and unfortunately no non veg stamp on her boarding pass?? so what is this have you trained your flight attendants to treat white skin as preference and priority and brown skin foreign national as me as secondary? does air vistara follow the British Raj system????  

NO REPLY AS YET FROM VISTARA TILL DATE AS OF NOW???????
CUSTOMER SERVICES ON CALL ARE DRIVING NUTS KEEPING ME ON HOLD FOR HOURS NOT ALLOWING TO TALK TO SUPERVISORS REQUESTED CALL BACK URGENT BASIS STILL NO ONE. THIS HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH ANXIETY TO THINK THAT AM I, OR THE FELLOW INDIAN PAX WHO WAS ALSO SITTING ASIDE FELT THE SAME WHEN THEY REQUESTED FOR NON VEG MEAL?

SO MUCH LIES THEY TOLD ME ONBOARD THAT WE NEED TO DO PRE MEAL BOOKING PRIOR BOARDING AND YET THERE IS NO SUCH OPTION FOR NON VEG OR VEG SIGHTED ONLY SIGHTED WAS EITHER NO PREFERENCE OR FRUIT PLATTER.

I EVEN ASKED THE WHITE LADY DID SHE REALLY DO A NON VEG MEAL SELECTION PRIOR BOARDING SHE SAID SHE NEVER WENT ONLINE TO DO THAT, AND YET THE LIES THAT CABIN STEWARDS TELL ON BOARD.

FEELS SICK THAT I USED THIS RACIST AIRLINE NO COURTESY TO EVEN CALL BACK ALSO TO REQUEST ANY RESOLUTION AS SUCH 

I FELT SO LOW BEING A FOREIGN NATIONAL TO INDIA AND WAS TREATED BY A LOW WELCOME TO STAY HUNGER FOR 6 HRS TILL MORNING I GOT NON VEG BREAKFAST OF EGG WHICH I WAS ALREADY HAVING SEVERE HEADACHE AND ANXIETY BY THAT TIME

DEAR DGCA KINDLY ASK FOR A RESOLUTION FROM THIS AIRLINE SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH LIGHT BROWN SKIN OR FELLOW INDIAN WITH BROWN SKIN NOT TO BE TREATED UNFAIRLY.

I GOT A REPLY FROM NODAL OFFICER OF VISTARA SAYING THE RESOLUTION HAS BEEN CLOSED VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT RESOLUTION FOR THIS HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT, ALTHOUGH I DO SAY THAT I DID RECIVE A CALL LAST MOMENT AFTER FOLLOWING UP MYSLEF THE DAY I COMPLETED 12DAYS IN INDIA I GOT THIS CALL SAYING WE APOLOZIE THATS ALL AND NO CORRECTIVE OR APPROPRIATE ACTION TAKEN ON THE CABIN ATTENDENT.

"Worst Ground Staff in Delhi Airport, Terminal 3",parykshit,New Delhi - Guwahati,"I booked 3 seats in Flight number UK 721 from Delhi to Guwahati for 19th December, 2021 with Vistara in Premium Economy for me , my wife and my 5 year old son . The departure time was 15.00 pm; we reached Delhi airport Terminal 3 on the 19th at around 13.00 and proceeded to the Premium Economy checkin counter to give our luggage and get the boarding cards. The personnel at the counter informed us that only 2 seats are available in Premium Economy and one will have to seat in Economy. The reason he gave was one of my Premium Economy seat was already given to someone else. I obviously didn’t agree and we kept going back and forth and him saying all the while that it was not possible to give all three seats in Premium Economy. He called two of his seniors and we went through the same process of they saying my Premium Economy seat was given to someone else and I not agreeing to it.  This continued for around 30-45 minutes and I and my family stood all this while at the checkin Counter with our luggage. The reason why I had booked all three Premium Economy seats together way ahead in advance is because in these Covid times I wanted me and my family to sit together and also we reached from Germany early morning of that day which is currently a high risk Covid country and it is safety concern for other passengers as well. And for an Airline which does marketing saying it takes Corona safety measures to keep passengers safe, one of the staff asked me ‘What Corona?’ when I told him we came from a high risk country. The Manager was finally called and he told me that we either fly in whichever way they want or miss the flight. He made it very clear that we comply to whatever they say. Eventually I had to agree to this bullying because it was already 14.30 and I had a small 5 year old boy who was tired after having flown from Germany early morning. I requested him to give an Economy Aisle seat to which he agreed. He explained  how he had to come all the way from some other part of Airport to take care of our matter as if he did a great favor to us. After reaching the boarding gate, he asked us to board the flight and I ended up in the middle seat in Economy class. I had to request the Air Hostess to give me a PPE kit since they didn’t even bother to take into consideration the safety concerns of me and passengers seated next to me. 
Vistara is so called best airlines in India and is this their service?

Bad experience by ground staff,Traveller,New Delhi - Ranchi,"I travel frequently within India and abroad. This particular incidence was not a major disappointment by an airline, however the attitude of ground staff made it one of the most memorable bad experiences. 
Date & Time: 21st November, 2021 around 4AM
Place: IGI Airport, Terminal 3, Domestic transfer
I just reached Delhi from a long-haul international flight and went to Vistara airline counter for my next domestic flight check-in. I had pre-booked all my access luggage and I was well within my purchased weight limit of 45Kg. However, the ground staff person handling the check-in process was so unaware of his own airlines’ rules and policies that all he cared about was charging me more money. Do they get a commission on the extra charges??? On top of that, this guy, let’s call him Mr. A, was so adversely trained in customer service, was very arrogant and adamant. He just didn’t care what I was explaining him. 
I literally had to bow down to his unfair demand, without which he refused to pass my luggage. Next, I went to cashier’s counter at the upper floor to make the payment. But luckily, I met this nice lady, Ms. L, who knew the rules and told me I don’t have to pay any more. She called Mr. A, downstairs and had to explain the rule quite a number of times. She also had to guide him how to navigate to the right screen in his system. Later I got a word that my luggage was released. However, least I knew, another round of bad experience was waiting for me.
After I reached my destination, Ranchi, found out my luggage was damaged. Why should I not assume that Mr. A had a role to play for my damage? Anyway, I made a complain of this and got a copy of Property Irregularity Report (PIR). For next two weeks, I was waiting to hear from the airline. But do you think the ground staff cares about travelers? So, I called the customer service. Found out, they had no information of the PIR so I explained them the situation again and my another wait begins.
What is so disheartening is, an airline which claims to be awarded with Best Airline, Best Domestic Airline and Favourite Domestic Airline etc. doesn’t train they ground staff well. The staff whom your customers meet first, even before experiencing the flight. 
Mr. Sia, Senior Vice President – Ground Services & Projects, should take a note of this. How can you have such ill-behaved people representing your business unit and the airline? People who hold grudge against your own customers. In a country where customer is regarded well and that too in a service industry? Have you ever experienced your services without letting the staff know of your position?

For starters, the system automatically provides the details you used to buy the ticket. Hurrah! No endless typing of information the airline already has. So refreshing. Secondly, the baggage drop desk was so smooth. Vistara open the maximum number of desks to ensure short queues and have staff available to deal with difficult issues such as visa and COVID documentation checks. We breezed through in no time. Finally, the flight itself was very pleasant. Helpful cabin crew, modern decor, decent food and a good movie selection.

"Horrible Customer Service, Like to Steal Money!",Rutvi P,Pune - New Delhi,"I want to preface this and say I understand that covid and new restrictions have caused a whirlwind of changes and I understand that mess-ups can happen. That being said, this has to be the worst treatment I've ever received from an airline from their customer service and sales department. 

I booked two tickets via Expedia since we live in the US to fly from Pune to Delhi in premium economy. A few days earlier I received an email saying that my flight time I had changed, and I just ignored it. I was getting there earlier than I needed to so why make a big deal out of it.  This morning I receive an email saying that not only my flight times have changed again, but now they've lowered by class to economy. They did not attach a refund, or offer any type of explanation for it. I called Expedia, and the poor agent tried for get in touch with Vistara Customer service for over 2 hours and 30 minutes and finally told me that she couldn't get through to anyone at Vistara and I have to wait for a call back for a refund that Expedia may or may not be able to do.

So for next try I called the number Vistara provides on their website for Customers in the US. The first person I spoke to was named Marina, she told me she was not responsible for customer service issues and can't do anything and I needed to call an  Indian number. I tried to explain to her that considering I am calling from the US, I cannot call the Indian number as I would rack up International Fees and considering this process is taking hours of my time, it should not be on me to spend additional money fixing their mistake. I asked her to speak to a manager or someone else who could find another way to get this fixed promptly and not via email. She proceeded to yell at me, refused to transfer to a manager, and disconnected. Called again, as soon as she heard it was us disconnected again. Called again, another member of the vistara team, continued to yell at us, and refused to listen or help us in anyway. Finally for the 4th time Marina, came on the phone and told us she had emailed someone who will reach back to us and that was that. No sort of apology or understanding of the fact that Vistara is actively currently charging us a hire fare for our current seats.

So for my third attempt, I thought it would be just best to cancel/refund the reservation. Having traveled for work and leisure all over, I'm starting to feel as if this airline may not be the best and quite possibly is a scam. This time I called Expedia again. Again the agent spent over 1 hour and 30 minutes trying to get anyone from Vistara to talk to him so he could help process the refund. He could not. After trying for that long, the furthest he got to was talking to Marina, who once again ignored all of his requests and told him to ""write an email"". When he asked for a quicker solution, as this ticket would need to be rebooked and whatnot she didn't care.

I'm over 5 hours deep into this now, and I feel completely exhausted. I feel like this airline has stolen my money and has no remorse for it whatsoever. I've never had customer service reps treat me as badly as Vistara's have. I've never had an issue so simple need so long to resolved/at this point who knows if it will. For any international customers looking to book, stay away!!

When asked for soft drinks - the only response was we serve only beer or orange juice.

Coffee? No we don't serve hot beverages on this flight. And their website mentions proudly serving Starbucks at 35,000 feet. Clearly a sham!

Their seat pitch is on the lower side too - 31 inches. They have managed to cram up 299 seats across all three classes. (compared to Air India's 33-inch seat pitch and 239 passengers on the same aircraft type)

Rude Cabin Crew UK-691 DEL-ATQ 30-OCT-2021,desiyatri,New Delhi - Amritsar,"Flight details: UK-691 DEL-ATQ 30-OCT-2021 Seat 25F

During the flight, the two female passengers on the seats next to me were holding handbags while seated. One of the cabin crew members asked them to keep the bags on the floor. The ladies were reluctant because the bags were small and probably contained some valuable stuff. Both the ladies were wearing seatbelts and their handbags were secure.  The crew member still insisted to keep the bags on the floor or in the locker.

I fly a lot and usually, this bags issue comes on the emergency exit row. Row 25 does not have an emergency exit. Because of that, I sought clarification from the concerned cabin crew.  The cabin crew responded rudely and said if the handbags were secure then why are you wearing seat belts, you can just hold on to your seats with your hands. That was absolutely uncalled for. 

I saw that same cabin crew misbehaving with some customers too. She was consistently speaking to the passengers in an angry tone.

I believe it is not the policy of the airline to misbehave with the passengers and it was just one frustrated cabin crew.

When i asked ground staff they were least bothered and didn’t even replied properly i was crying on airport i was all alone this was mental harassment.

Over 110 passengers stranded inside flight due to airline's neglegence at 10.30 in the night,Shailesh R,Hyderabad - Mumbai,"The airline boarded a minor without checking his documents. 
Then realized that some basic documents of that boy were missing when flight was about to take off at 9.30 pm.

There was no announcement by the crew for 90 minutes.

110++ passengers were kept in dark by the flight crew until I requested them to announce the issue and inform all passengers the reason of delay properly.

The boy was crying !

Think twice before you book with Vistara,h2982,London - New Delhi,"I do not like to leave negative reviews be this airline should not be allowed to run. The customer services are extremely poor.

India has a policy where any UK passengers have to quarantine for 10 days of arrival. I had booked a ticket for 7 days and the airline refused to change my dates or allow a cancellation without imposing a big fee. Even though this was a requirement from the Indian Government and Airlines had been told about this. I wrote to the Nodal Officer Harjit Bhatia. This person did not care at all and demanded charges would apply. They did not consider the government rule of quarantine and are only looking at how to profit from the customer.

I do not recommend this airline to anyone who has had an issue like me. I would understand if it was a voluntary date change but what I kept telling vistara was that I need to stay in India for a minimum of 10 days under the rule which they wanted fee's for.

Like any other,Sunny C,Hyderabad - Sharjah,"The travel was in 2 legs - HYD-BOM and BOM-SHJ. Both legs were on A320 Neo equipment. Was it an illusion that the seating on the first leg of the journey, felt more spacious and comfortable than the second leg of BOM-SHJ? The flight to SHJ was crammed with 90%+ load and the seating/legroom seemed crammed - to what seemed like being stuck in crammed seat for eternity. No inflight entertainment. Dinner service was efficient and courteous. There were no snacks and or beverages served on the first leg lasting 1 hour 15mins. 

Inside the aircraft the seats and equipment were well kept and well maintained.  A welcome change was the crowd control by the FA's during disembarkation by calling out the rows in orderly manner. Hope this is adopted by all Indian carriers and a sense of discipline and courtesy is instilled in the traveling pax.

Reason for choosing - Price of the Ticket - which was relatively cheaper than the Direct flights from HYDto DXB.

Then the staff and manager Ajay Singh at the Delhi airport lied to us by telling us to do the security check in and get a boarding pass from inside which is a lie you cannot go through a security check in without a boarding pass. With all the false information and running around for hours the manager Ajay Singh promised us help which in turn did nothing for us. We ended up buying brand new tickets for something which isn’t our fault and caused by mismanagement of Ajay Singh.

Horrible experience! Never fly with Vistara!,DJ703,Frankfurt - Kochi (Cochin),"My flight had a stopover at Delhi. I had called customer care of frankurt, and India to confirm the details of transfer at Delhi airport. Both times, your customer care folks confirmed that luggage needs to be collected only at kochi, there is immigration at Delhi and that's all you have to clear. I confirmed this with your staff at check-in counter at Frankfurt airport and they said we have to collect our baggage, clear customs and drop it in the nearby transfer counter. 

On arriving at Delhi, everything changed. We had to finish immigration, collect our baggage ,clear customs,  then repack all our duty free items into check-in baggages, then check-in again, clear security and board the next flight.  And all these needs to be done in 2 hour 35 mins which was nearly impossible. When we booked our tickets, we had layover time of 6 hours and Vistara changed the start time of flight, thereby reducing the layover time and made no arrangements for this delay at Delhi.

There was absolutely no help from Vistara ground staff at Delhi for making our transfer easier. All they said was ""run if you want to catch your connection and ask people in front to skip the queue"", which is very pathetic since it's Vistara's responsibility to ensure our transfer is smooth. All this happened after we specifically enquired about duty free items and baggage transfer.

Worst Customer Service at Delhi Airport Reservations Desk,Manish S,New Delhi - Hyderabad,"I had a ticket with United Airlines with Vistara as their partner airline for last leg of the flight. Vistara was not able to find my last leg ticket in their systems (some glitch between United and Vistara systems sharing the information).

I had to spend 4 hours with Vistara Staff which was indifferent for first 2 hours saying - it's not our fault, our systems don't show it. I called United customer service on phone and tried to resolve it while working with Vistara - so all three are on the same page with phone on speaker phone. While the phone is on speaker phone and United staff is trying different things and asking Vistara staff to check ticket numbers/PNR,  the staff working the desk - Amit M. - just got up and left. I thought, he might be taking a minute break to restroom, but no, he just left and came back after an hour - while we are on phone, without any notice.

There was only one other staff member, Prachi N who was a little more helpful than other staff member but after wasting another hour she could not help. I told them that the flight is in 2 hours and this needs to be resolved for me to take the flight and I want to talk to their supervisor. Only then, they raised the issue with someone else on phone who tried to fix it with United. All while they were saying not to worry issue will be fixed.

In the end, the issue was not fixed for one of the three members of my family and I had to pay extra money at airport to catch the flight I already paid United for. They also waited for last minute. They asked a porter to help me through security for faster access to gates, and I had to pay him INR 500 for the help. Even with that, I literally had to RUN to get to the gates and was last one to board the flight. 

Customer service is not judged when things are good, but when the things are bad and Vistara failed miserably on this!

Lack of information from staffs,Shakir C,Ahmedabad - Sharjah,"Booking reference number :- L6XVI7

I am writing today to share my experience with vistara helpline assistance. It was a first time I booked with vistara for an experience but I was very much disappointed with the fact that staff are not well informed and briefed from the seniors for the new updates and travel guidelines.

05/08/2021 :- I booked my ticket from Ahmedabad to Sharjah via Delhi. I updated all my details required to travel as per the guidelines the only thing left was the ICA approval email that i didn’t received. 

06/08/2021 :-   I called customer care assistance to check with them what will be the situation if I don’t receive any ICA approval by email though I had screen shot with the green letter stating that I fulfill the travel requirement. Vistara agent informed me that its mandatory to get approval through mail if not they won’t do boarding.

2. I called again twice on the same day to check with another team member if they can provide any detailed information that how it gonna work out. But all were saying the same thing.

07/08/2021 :- I got an information from my colleague who travelled from Delhi to Sharjah through Air Arabia. He mentioned that even he didn’t received ICA approval in mail but the Air Arabia team assisted him to get the bar code at the checking counter and he reached sharjah safely.

I called Delhi airport and got number (7303210042) of vistara checking counter to confirm if they can assist in the same way for boarding like Air Arabia. Agent told me that she cannot assist in this scenario as they don’t have anything to do with that as its from UAE embassy. It was very weird to hear that and I called again later to know from someone else but it was same response.

At the end after all this till 20:00PM i didn’t receive any approval mail so I decided to cancel my reservation and I agreed to pay for the cancellation fees as per the policy though it was very sad to take the decision but their was no other alternative left.

Just after i canceled my booking my colleague sent me the guideline from Vistara which was uploaded on twitter on that guideline no where it was mentioned to get confirmed ICA approval mail. I was very disappointed to hear as i just cancelled booking and no one from team acknowledge and assisted with that.

I called helpline again to inform the team if they can rebook or at least do free cancellation as there was poor service and information was never escalated clearly by team multiple times. On last call the lady with whom I spoke she was not even aware of ICA term she asked me what is it?? It was first time she encountered with this term. 

What else to say you should understand that it was too much miscommunication and misleading information. I should get at least free cancellation as a service recovery. Now i received my ICA barcode after the new update from the UAE govt at 00:15 AM but there is nothing i can do to re book as the flights are fully booked.",International,2.0,August 2021,7 August 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Shockingly just before boarding they’re told they cannot avail the allocated seats as they’re senior citizens. When I asked for the refund - naturally, since they themselves offered me the two seats on their own and charged me 1600/- - they blatantly declined saying it is non-refundable.

Really pathetic show from a TATA enterprise. Had my trust in Vistara brand until today - but it all broke now. They’ve proved themselves to be just some other two-bit thieves who want to siphon off innocent customers under the pretext of additional charges making utterly false promises.

Called up customer care over 5 occasions - and their executives make me wait deliberately keeping me on hold for more than half hour. Utterly disgraceful.

VISTARA cancelled the flight due to operational reason and rescheduled it for 24 Apr. Again I was told by VISTARA the 24 Apr tickets were not issued and no seats were available(even though we boked the seats and got the seat number as well). 

Then we were provided with a new date, 28 Apr and by that time UK government had put INDIA in Red country list. So I ended up cancelling the ticket and VISTARA very clearly told me the cancellation charge will be INR 27300 (almost £275). I paid £1952 for the tickets and in return got only £1334 as refund. Called the customer service more than 5 times and nobody has any clue what went wrong. Every time I was put on hold and then the call gets disconnected.

Horrible Customer experience,Zubika,New Delhi - Dubai,"Please never book with this airline. You will have to deal with uneducated and untrained staff. They changed my flight sharing incorrect details with me. 

I had to wait on the hold queue of customer service line for 2 hours - 3 days at a stretch as the staff is so incompetent. 

Also they filed my complaint and promised to call back. They never gor back to me. I had to call again and yet again wait in the queue before any solution could be offerred.

Even at the airport the staff was arguiging over things that they didnt even know about. In times of worry like covid they can only add onto your stress levels. 

I eventually cancelled my booking and booked with other airline as I couldnt deal with the stress levels. Rather pay extra than deal with such people.

Worst experience! No option but pay up separate check-in bag fee !!,Jay,Chennai (Madras) - Dublin,"Journey:Chennai->Mumbai->Amsterdam->Dublin.
Domestic-Vistara.International-KLM. It’s one PNR all the way.

My ticket did not include Check-In bag. When called up Vistara customer care they said they have a partnership with KLM so its sufficient for me to pay just 75 USD (for KLM) directly at the Chennai airport for my entire journey. Even KLM advised the same.
But at Chennai airport, Vistara staff did not listen to all this and made me pay INR 8050 just to take my check in bag from Chennai to Mumbai.Despite my numerous explanations, all I was told is that the Vistara customer care team gave me a wrong information.
NOW WHY SHOULD THE PASSENGER BE RESPONSIBLE and BEAR THIS ADDITIONAL BAGGAGE FEE if the mistake is made on Vistara customer care side. I had no option but to Pay-up!
When called customer care over phone to escalate the matter, they are re-confirming that I should not have been charged this extra Rs.8050 at the airport and just 75USD. Complaint no. TCT202103313573178.
A senior executive from Customer relations responded over my complaint. All he did was to re-iterate ""excess baggage has been charged as per the policy"".
They had no answer to my simple question-""Why was I given a wrong/misleading information that I need to pay check-in bag fee of 75USD for my entire journey but in the airport I was told otherwise and charged the excess fee of Rs.8050"".

1. They told me for connecting flight from Doha to Jammu, I don’t need to collect bags at Delhi, i will get it directly at Jammu. Which was incorrect and I found out otherwise at the check in time. This is a trip my wife was traveling with a 3 year old and a 6 year old. I would have made her stay extra day if I knew of the connection hassle. 
2. They told me that I will get special assistance at the airport and will get a confirmation email or an acknowledgment on my request if I sent it through email. When I followed up about my email that now say it will take 24h to 48h for response while my wife is arriving Delhi in 3 hours time. 
3. Traveling business class one would think entrainment system would be standard. I was so wrong. Not only did they not have a TV or screen. They had no wifi connected entertainment system either. My kids went through torture of a time. 
4. The air hostess in the flight was so rude despite flying business class that her displeasure in serving my family was evident on her face. 
5. Finally, at the Vistara counter they told us that they don’t provide service to drop off till connecting flight.

Poor Customer Service and care,Yajati G,London - Kolkata (Calcutta),"As a Tata and Singapore Airlines venture, I was extremely disappointed with the lack of care and customer service.
Flights were cancelled on both legs without intimation to us and no contact was made to rebook, which is an IATA requirement. The emails are non-functional and a single telephone contact portal ensures you are hanging on forever. If you are lucky to get through, the operators are not at all helpful.
Once airborne the service is not bad considering the COVID constraints.

Terrible Check In experience with the airline staff and supervisor at Delhi airport.,Sahil Singla,New Delhi - Chandigarh,"The check in staff was not informed on the baggage policy, made me wait for about 15 mins while she checked with someone on call. There was no response from the other line and she made a random decision to charge me for my carry on bag (INR 8000) which was apparently way more than the cost of ticket itself. Her supervisor (Seema) was just interested in moving the queue and she would not listen to the details of my booking. Eventually i was getting late for the flight and had no option other than to give in at that time to get my boarding pass.

More details:

I was flying from Chicago to Chandigarh and my domestic leg from New Delhi to Chandigarh was booked on United Airlines operated by Vistara. I had 2 check in bags + carry on bag + laptop bag, all under permissible weight limits and typical of an international flight from USA to India. I was not sure about the size of the aircraft in the domestic flight so I inquired if my carry on bag would fit in or not. They mentioned it won’t and even if it did it is above 7kg limit for a carry on bag and instead of taking the risk i should check in and pay fo 15kgs instead. 
This was inspite of me showing them the vistara policy which had to honour the same baggage allowance for connections from international flights within 48 hrs. 

Her recommendation was that i either magically get rid of my 8kg belongings or pay up to board the flight, given the departure time I had no option other than to pay up which I felt was completly unjustified. To make matters worse the supervisor on floor (Seema) was completly rude and interested in chatting up with her friends than pay attention to any questions from customers.

Fast forward, I boarded the flight,half empty and huge spaces for carry on bags in thr flights and knowing all that she still made me check in the bag for additional amount. I felt completly ridiculous and betrayed and I hope that the airlines invest some time in teaching manners and policies to their front end staff.",Domestic,1.0,March 2021,6 March 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,N/A
I will NEVER again fly Vistara!,Swati D,Kolkata (Calcutta) - New Delhi,"I flew Vistara yesterday (in March 2021), when the second wave of Covid is on the upward curve.  Most of the passengers had no masks on, forget the face shield.  The fellow next to me (in the middle seat) did not even have his PPE gown on.  None of the Vistara staff said anything to any of the ones around me!  If I come down with COVID-19, it will be entirely because of them!!

The food (advertised as hot meal on their website) was just an extremely cold tiny vegetarian puff of very average quality and two tiny cookies, with a small bottle of water.  No juice, no tea or coffee.  So what if their website boasts of great Starbucks coffee?  Their website says I can pre-choose my meal.  When I called cutomer care, they said that was not possible and I would only have to accept whatever was available.  Why can they not update their website?

Boarding was supposed to commence at 08:55 but actually commenced at 09:25.

They said i can dump my children at airport fly on my own

Lost around 3000 pounds. Every single vistara staff are lauging and watching me and children runing around all over the airport.

Worst airline in terms of COVID safety and staff behaviour,Ishan6987,Bhubaneswar - New Delhi,"Hello fellow travellers,

As an aviation expert and ex- aviation staff i mist say that this airline is not at all professional and safe to travel during this pandemic. First of all they don't follow the protocol of safe distancing and the in-flight service is substandard. If you are planning any trip to india or abroad with this airline then be careful to experience the same. Vistara was on my high end expectations after Jet Airways went out of business, however this airline is not even equal to the standard of Indigo - The best LCC in india. The staff in this company are pretty much clueless and the tone they use to treat customers is way too rude. I think the airline should start providing communication classes to its staff.
I have travelled this airline few times and everytime i was disappointed by some or the other factor. As per my experience i would rate this airline as the worst airline in India.",Domestic,3.0,N/A,22 December 2020,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worst Ground Experience(Mumbai Airport),officialdaringdeepika,Mumbai - Amritsar,"Hello there!!!
This is with regards to my flight UK 994. I must say, This is the worst flight experience I have ever had. Starting from check-in , in -flight & security, I seriously felt Vistara has stopped believing in Customer relation service!
I would like to mention Rujal , Arun ,Avinash & Ana(Ground staff) who do not know how to solve customer issues!! Why have I mentioned these four names because being seniors in their hierarchy they all assumed they have paid for customers' tickets and they could play with them around !! I mean instead of finding a solution they straight away asked me to cancel my ticket!
As soon as I went to the counter for check in I just asked them how much allowance I have for baggage because my family travelled several times through Vistara and they could have carried 20kg due to Covid or whatever!!!! But what I learned is that I can travel with one piece for 15kg! Fair enough!!I tried to shuffle a few things in my hand baggage which was almost empty. But As per policy there is some limitation to carry liquid in hand bags as I was carrying a few liquid bottles and so they could have adjusted  my handbag weight in the check in bag. And it’s not that I was not ready to pay for  extras, but asked them to adjust two -three kg!
First thing I did was travelling to attend a marriage which I have mentioned to staff and cant leave any of the stuff here but  they have suggested me to calI someone to come to the airport to take back my extra kgs which could be adjusted in a hand bag!!! Which they didn’t allow me to do.Secondly I have told them that  I am not carrying enough money so allowed me to carry a few kgs extra in a check in bag since I don’t have much in hand!!!Thirdly,  they kept sending me from one person to another!! I was making my fool talking and waiting for their response!Literally I was running behind them and I got so angry when your staff Rujal was making fun of me with her other employees and I could read her lips that she abused me!These are heights and specially Arun and Avinash seem more interested to hear Rujal’s instruction rather than listening to me!!!Ana was at-least professional but she was more interested to cancel my booking.  
I think you should train your staff how to handle customers. This is absolutely not the way to treat a lady travelling alone, instead of helping, they were rude and abusive. This has given mea traumatic experience!!

I seriously regretted booking this flight ,I could have taken Air India as their member too!!
Mumbai to Delhi cabin crew were good but Delhi-Amritsar crew were also so annoying!!, I  mean was eating and no one would have worn a mask while eating. but one of the crew was so rude and ordered me as if she was a teacher ..I mean,There is always a way to inform!!

They are the worst. I now know which airline not to choose.,Pramesh Bajracharya,Chennai (Madras) - Kathmandu,"I booked another ticket from Vistara and it was canceled by them (NOT BY ME).

But, this useless airlines has no intention of refunding my tickets (by no means - no credit shells as well). It took me 5 hours to get through their customer care and the guy simply answers that there will be no refund. WTF? 

What was my fault here? How is this fair first of all? Can airlines even do this? What about the rule from the government that said - refund should be provided if the flight has been canceled from the airline side? And mainly, what about this - “The policy of the Central Government is that every individual passenger has a right to seek refund of those tickets, the flight for which was canceled without any fault of his/hers. It is stated that non-refund of fare amounts to violation of provisions of the CARs,” the DGCA addressed the court. Doesn't this mean they are violating the law? Somebody needs to scrutinize them I tell you.

I am in distress and I wonder how many people faced this. What about other people? 15K is a huge sum.

Curse vistara airlines. Just go and learn something from Indigo. I booked with Indigo and they refunded the full amount without me contacting them.

And on the other note, when calling your customer service, how dare you to call yourself as best airlines in India? Was it supposed to make us laugh? Shame on you.

At the end of the day, if you treat your customers like this then do no expect to run properly. I literally despise you guys now. I hope you follow the faith of Jet airways and go bankrupt soon.

Worst telephonic customer support.,Alban Sathia,Dubai - Chennai (Madras),"1. Worst phone customer support
2. The Mumbai staff ( Dilip Kumar Pandey ) and one more manager couldn't recollect the name who where at the airport at 4 am in the morning . Were really helpful 
3. The Manager in Dubai was Also helpful (I don't remember her name ) 
4. The other supervisor - Dubai ( Brayan ) not sure about the name ) refused to help, when requested and asked for him to share the Same via E-mail he agreed to help.

They said through check-in till Chennai
Mumbai after clearing the immigration one of the Vistara staff approached and Said i can't take the connecting flight and was trying to stall me in Mumbai coz the Mumbai health workers has to allow without getting Quarantined - 
RT PCR test report negative .
Rapid test report negative.
Self declaration for exemption for home Quarantine for 14 based on the RT PCR test
E-pass to travel back home in Chennai.

Had to argue with the Vistar staff and supervisor and the health workers and their supervisors - just heartless and rude , who couldn't speak English ( Hindi is not India's National Language ) and i had to tell them to stay away not to come near me.

SOCIAL DISTANCE NORMS WHERE NOT FOLLOWED AT ALL . ALL THE 4 HEALTH WORKERS WERE AT THE SAME SMALL DESK . 

After screaming and yelling at the so called health workers they let me get out to the next gate where my connecting flight was at 9 am and they told me to wait at the entrance because i can only go in after they open the counter at 6. Another round of yelling and screaming they let me in . During the next security check . The CISF personal said i can't carry battery for my device and had to be in the check-in luggage . After arguing and talking to the Asst.Comm of CISF they let me go ( bunch of people working without understanding the basics and commonsense ) 

Social distancing was followed 

DXB - BOM - FOLLOWED
BOM - BLR - NOT FOLLOWED
BLR - MAA - PACKED FLIGHT NOT FOLLOWED

Why act when the flight is in the international bountries saying we are following the physical distancing ??

When i booked it was DXB - BOM : BOM - MAA

I got a call concerning the safety of the passengers they are made me stop twice and full flight . 

No idea how TripAdvisor had Give the best award . 

Question to TripAdvisor : Did Vistara pay you to give them the best award ?

Or the Judiciary panel is just for Eyes ??

Service should be rendered on need bacis or when requested not after arguing and demanding .

Just hope less apart from the few managers who helped . 

People just be careful when you are booking their own connecting flights ..

Vistara customer service is worst. It provided wrong information regarding the extra baggage purchase and mede me pay extra money and buy it. After 2 days they cancelled the flight from their end and when contacted regarding the refund they refused to provide it blaming the whole situation on COVID. How can they rob passengers hard earned money and keep it by not providing any service. Their agent had called me saying at least the extra money i had paid for baggage will be refunded, but it was a lie, they did not respond when contacted and most of the time they pretend as if they do not understand the customers problem.

India's Best Airlines!,Souvik,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"In March 2020, I had the sudden opportunity to fly with Vistara with my entire family. For the rest of the members, it was their first time flying with them. It was a last-minute booking made at the airport. We had a really bad day since the morning and all of us (including the 2 kids) were under a lot of stress. But that started to change the moment we stood for checked in. Seeing that we were a large group, the customer service member immediately took us to a counter that had only 2 persons in front of us. The person who checked us in was very courteous and explained us each & every important details of the boarding pass as if we were flying for the first time (unbeknownst to him, it was in fact my 107th flight) :) He couldn't confirm whether meal is included in the ticket though. For that I called the customer service phone number and after almost no wait time got through a nice customer service representative who cleared our doubts promptly. The boarding commenced on time and it was done in a very smooth and orderly manner. Right at the door of the aircraft we were greeted by friendly cabin crew, who took special care in bringing smile to my little daughter. I was surprised to experience the fresh look and feel of the cabin. I, then, looked up the registration of the aircraft (VT-TNW) and found that we were about to fly in just a 3 months old aircraft :O The seat back was loaded with features to hold all possible items, the seats were comfortable and squeaky clean. We started the push back right on time and after we took off, the cabin crew started serving dinner with great efficiency. When I enquired about the menu choices, the extremely friendly cabin crew showed us the actual content, which we loved. Now my son hates rice and doesn’t eat that ever. But other than the small bread roll, the meal tray did not have much carbohydrate options left for him. He is a great fan of paneer though. But smelling the really nice aroma of the pilaf, which was in the same container with paneer curry, he could not resist himself. He started taking both pilaf and palak paneer curry with the spork! He liked it so much that he even finished another plateful of pilaf and rice!! I could not believe my own eyes! My daughter also liked the food but she was more interested in watching the movie Frozen in my phone, which I was streaming from the IFE. It played flawlessly during the entire duration of the flight. The cabin crew was one of the friendliest I’ve met in all the Indian carriers. They made eye contacts, smiled back when smiled at and took genuine care of the passengers. My apologies for not asking and noting down their names during the journey.

The entire journey was extremely smooth and it helped us in releasing all the stresses that accumulated throughout the day. The plane stopped at the gate at CCU airport 2 minutes before time :) I was quite thrilled by getting such a world class service at economy class. My daughter, who is not a great fan of flying due to the ear pain that she gets during take-off and landing, even said that flying by Vistara was the top 3 memories of our 6-day trip. 

I know that right now you are going through very difficult times due to COVID-19. But know this - my family is eagerly waiting for you to start the Dreamliner service post COVID-19. We are hoping that you will be starting the service to one of the UK/European destinations.

Finally the meal came and it was made of soyabean(a wheat product ). I was aware so I could get it changed.  Someone like my mom who is allergic as well can not spot the difference and would’ve suffered a reaction.

Okay for a short hop,R1chardN,Lucknow - New Delhi,"The flight was about 75% full and so was quite comfortable.  The seats were sufficient for a short flight and the leg room satisfactory.  We were served a snack which was not necessary - we were in the air for about 50 minutes.
This is an internal flight but is used by tourists who have taken international flights to get to India and have sufficient luggage for the duration of their holiday.  The allowance of 15k per person is inadequate and so be prepared to pay excess baggage.  If you are taking an international flight within 24 hours there seems to be some discretion to increase the allowance to the usual 25k.

This has happened earlier also on Vistara flights from Ahmedabad to Delhi. No fault of the airline which may like to relook at the schedule to accommodate such delays.
It is a fine airline and I have always enjoyed flying with them. Premium Economy is a great innovation for those who do not wish to splurge on Business but want more comfort than Economy. I wonder why Vistara does not fly between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, there are more than a dozen flights every day but none of Vistara.

However, I think there is scope for improvement.  For example, the meals that they serve in the domestic sector, it's always the same.  No new menus are introduced. Their cabin crew announcements could be more articulate. The delivery of the services can be more efficient.

Worst flying experience for my family,Abhi,Austin - Pune,"So I booked a flight from Austin to Pune (PNQ) which had a international to domestic change at Delhi international airport. I thought how hard could that be. it will be better for My 10 month old baby to travel domestic in India rather than drive from mumbai to pune (which takes 2 hours)
But as it turns out my decision was the worst decision in terms of choosing flights.
It was great from Austin to Delhi. But as soon as we landed, things got bad. Vistara airlines just didnt care that me and my wife were travelling with an Infant.
We got immigration done, got our bags and headed to domestic transfer and reached vistara baggage counter. 
There were still 45MIN  LEFT for the flight to depart (about 30 MIN for GATE CLOSE). 
Usually the counter tells the customers that no this time is not enough for you to travel from this counter to the gate (Because Delhi airport is LONG LONG walk AND WITH a 10 month INFANT it was IMPOSSIBLE).
But the vistara agent decided to not mention that and told us to run to the gate. 
At that point, I thought since we put our bags in the agent will PHONE IN to the gate that we are headed to the gate... But NO. We run to the GATE with THE INFANT AND THEY CLOSE THE GATE ON US!!!!!!
Yes, WE WERE ONLY 1 MIN LATE THEY SAID... WE BEGGED THEM TO LET US IN... THEY COULD HAVE WAITED 5 more min/CALLED IN THE BAGGAGE COUNTER TO ASK ABOUT US!
Then I realized its no use after they started giving me ridiculous reasons.
Then they dragged us back to the check in counters which was a LONG WALK BACK... GREAT.
Then they tell us that the next flight is after 5 HOURS and... the best part... they cannot guarantee the tickets (on hold) because its not the policy??? 
SO I DONT KNOW IF I HAVE TICKETS FOR THE NEXT FLIGHT!!!!
VISTARA THEN MAKES ME BUY THE FLIGHT TICKETS (RS 30,000)
Now I understand that international to domestic change in India is the worst... 
I think Vistara just didnt think this possibility through...",International,3.0,December 2019,28 February 2020,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
"Never book an International connection: Zero customer service, nightmarish experience, heartless airline",Rahul G,Bagdogra - Sydney,"Detailing the harrowing experience my senior citizen parents went through due to lack of empathy from Vistara.

1. Roundtrip tickets booked from Bagdogra to Sydney via Vistara (domestic) and Singapore Airlines(International) on a single PNR.

2. On the return leg, SIA checked my parents up to Delhi for an onward connection to Vistara.

3. Severe crowds at Delhi airport baggage claim and immigration delayed my parents.

4. No on ground staff from Vistara to assist or enquire.

5. They issued boarding passes for Bagdogra just in time; but my parents couldnt catch their flight due to crowd delays through security at Delhi Airport.

5. Vistara flatly refused any arrangements and repeatedly blamed us for booking a ""tight connection""

6. Their representatives were rude and uncooperative and my parents were left to fend for themselves.

7. Baggage returned after more than 2 hours.

7. Tired and exhausted, they booked an Air Asia Flight.

8. Their customer relations - International connection: Zero customer service, nightmarish experience, heartless airline, nodal officer - Nishant Khanna and Appellate Authority- Pooja Paul didn't care to respond to my email.

9. Logged a case with AirSewa and they responded immediately with a standard excuse "" We do not have control on airport security/immigration.....etc""

We thought it night be just once happening but again during retire journey, we had same nice experience. 

Also it is worth to tention about in-flight entertainment on mobile. Nice you download and register your self on Vistara world app, then once on-board you can open that app and using available vistara wifi, enjoy movies,
Shows etc for hours together without interruption.

Overall nice experience. But aircrafts from inside are now looking worn out. Vistara must do something about it soon.

Lousy Feeling!,Bluecann,Bangkok - New Delhi,"I took UK122 from Bangkok to Delhi on 7th February. As I normally do, I had checked in online and also had a confirmed seat number.
 
When I arrived at the airline counter, and received my boarding pass, I noticed my seat number had changed. I was not told so by the check in person. Never happened in over 30 years of traveling, I asked for the reason. The check in person at Vistara blamed it on the system. 

Not convinced, I kept pressing. He then responded that he had changed it because another passenger wanted that seat. That was a shocking response. I insisted on getting my confirmed seat back (as I was sitting with the rest of my family). It created chaos and finally I was asked to see the manager before boarding when I got my old seat back.

After my return, I wrote to Customer Service about this incident as well as the slow inflight service, rude check in staff at Delhi airport and the general violation of flight safety rules. I received a general, pre-packaged and standard response about the philosophies of customer service without addressing any of the specifics I had mentioned. 

I wrote back and said so. I received another general, pre-packaged and standard response which still did not explain what had happened. I can only assume my specific feedback with dates, flight numbers has been ignored under the guise of a standard response.

After this experience  and how Customer Service has handled my complain (more like ignored it), it’s hard to imagine that Singapore Airlines and TATA are backing this airline.
 
My take is that the customer service expectations from airlines in India are so low, given the damage caused by Air India, that Vistara was a welcome change for domestic flights. But, on international flights, Vistara is up against the best airlines, and its ‘Air India’ philosophy and culture will not work. I will certainly avoid it next time.

Vistara needs to transfer the best practices from Singapore Airlines and not the culture of failed airlines in India. Otherwise, remain a domestic airline and try to be the ‘relative best’.",Asia,1.0,February 2020,20 February 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Good to travel by Vistara but it seems to be going Jet airways. Success seems to be going over board in their minds..,Dr. DineshBhasin,New Delhi - Mumbai,"The in-house  WiFi was not working well. While this is one feedback, the crew( Airhostess doesn't give a damn to the feedback) also didn't help. She was busy completing her job( serving snacks) as per SOP( Standard Operating procedures) and although she said she will look into it, she didn't despite reminder. On one side Vistara takes pride in advertising the inflight WiFi, it doesn't work in domestic flights that well as it does internationally. Thats fine but what prevents the Airhostess to inform the actions taken on a complaint? Not even on this flight, on my earlier flights also, I have started seeing 'rudeness' in there behaviour. Hence I say, they are going Jet airways way. But, then, jet was a leader for many years. Success has gone into Vistara staff rather earlier. While serving coffee, even a tissue was not offered. It was placed rather rudely on my table, as if she is doing a favour.",Domestic,3.0,February 2020,20 February 2020,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
One of the worst Experience,Binal,Ahmedabad - New Delhi,"We booked the ticket being a gold member for 3 of our family members. it was booked in a premium economy class. we paid almost 25k for 3 tickets from Ahmedabad to Delhi

We were not sure about the dates but we still booked in an impression that, being a gold member and premium economy we can change dates in certain situation. 

Due to unavailability of holidays given to my parents as they are government servant, We have to change the dates of the flight. We called customer care and he told us that each ticket will cost around 7k for date change. insane. my new ticket for that date was costing me 5k. we ended up taking a new ticket with Air India now. 

At the end, they did not agree for a date change complimentary or with some minimal cost, we have to cancel all 3 tickets and we lost almost 20k with that tickets. Now we are getting refund of 1.7k on each ticket. 

They dont care or show a courtsey for gold members. what they must be doing for regular customers.

Cheap Airline - Pathetic Customer Service - Low Quality Staff,AVOID AWFUL VISTARA,New Delhi - Ahmedabad,"At the time of booking we requested a wheelchair as I was travelling with my 80+yrs mother. But wheel chair wasnt provided.

They made my 80+yrs mother to walk upto gate 41. When we were at gate 39, next to gate 41, I received a phone call from Vistara personnel asking about our whereabouts, I mentioned to him that we were walking past gate 39 and will be at gate 41 in less than 30 seconds and he replied come over. When we reached the gate, we rushed to the counter and handed our boarding passes to the attendant. The attendant was on the phone and didn’t give a damn about us. The attendant’s name is Kalyani, absolutely untrained, unprofessional and unethical pathetic makeup clad girl. She did not look at us and kept on talking on the phone. From the conversation that I overheard I realized that she was instructing somebody to offload our bags. The guys present there even said to her that let these people board the plane but she was busy flirting with the person on the phone along with work related conversation. One person also mentioned that you just let that person go a few seconds ago then why not these guys but she ignored. I said to her that we are on this flight and if she could let us go and then continue chatting over the phone but she did not pay any attention. Kalyani intentionally did not allow us to board the plane, most probably to satisfy her low esteem ego. There was still time yet she tried to show her importance to us and took this step. Once the plane was pulled back that’s when she spoke with us saying that the plane has left and thus we cannot get on the plane though we were already there in advance. Is this what Vistara trains their staff for? I believe your business is all about the people and if you don’t take care of people then there will be always somebody else who will. 

Then from the boarding door, appeared four people working for Vistara, out of which one recognized himself as Gaurav, the manager, and he said to Kalyani with a smile that put these people on the next flight at no charge, so first get them out of here and then ask them to reenter. A guy with wheelchair showed up then and asked my mother to sit, I asked him where would he be taking us and he said out of the airport, I said no we wont be going anywhere from here, why do we need to repeat the whole process when we are the same people.

In the meantime, Kalyani started to act like being busy and after about 10 minutses, I requested her to issue our boarding passes for the next flight to AMD and she said that she doesn’t have that ability, we will have to exit and reenter and then get our new boarding passes from the ticketing counter. This is not what Gaurav, who recognized himself as manager said. So I requested to speak with Gaurav but Kalyani wouldn’t ring her or give us his number. On repeated requests she rang him but Gaurav refused to talk with me because he realized that he had misled us with his sweet talk and released the weigh off his shoulders. 

Feeling helpless and left stranded by the new awful feeling Vistara staff, I went to information desk to find out more information. I was advised that if we exit then we wont be able to reenter the airport without a valid ticket, so the Vistara guys have misinformed & misled you. You should be accompanied by a Vistara staff then only they will let you go out through security and advised not to go out of the airport. After which one of the airport buggy car guys accompanied us and spotted Gaurav, the manager and confronted him about misleading us and that is when Gaurav changed his story and started telling lies. What kind of managers does Vistara appoint who are so irresponsible and afraid of taking the ownership of the task? Are you trying to repeat the tata nano success story? You guys should be ashamed of yourselves for treating passengers like this. Gaurav’s plan was to get us out of the airport so that we cannot reenter and have to buy a new ticket to reenter the airport and this means that he has one less thing to manage. Seems this is how Vistara has trained and taught managers to treat passnegers? I think such guys within your company should be paid a bit extra so that they can shop around and buy some “Shame”, if their parents haven’t taught them.

We were then accompanied by a Vistara staff and we were brought to the ticketing counter. On approaching the ticketing counter, I explained them the whole situation after which they were asking us to pay a full fare for the next flight. I said to them that the guy named Gaurav, who recognised himself as a manager said that there will be no cost and they said that we do no have any manager by the name of Gaurav and then they asked me his last name. I explained them that this Gaurav guy is the one who met us at the gate and from the looks of it he is responsible for the dispatch of the flights. The guy said I don’t know any Gaurav who’s a manager with us. What kind of staff you guys have got where staff refuse to recognize other staff members? Then he rang the same Gaurav that I was talking about and spoke with him and after the phone call they asked us to pay INR 1000/person. I mentioned that we were being told that there would be no charge and the response we received was go and get that Gaurav and ask him to do it, we did not knew where this guy would be neither this guy would tell us about his current location. This meant that the guy knew this Gaurav but was acting that he didn’t knew him. Spare an award for this guy at your next annual function. Upto a certain extent Gaurav also realised that a mistake was done on their part by not letting us board the plane. Nowhere there is any information about gate closing time before the departure. The next flight was next day morning. They made us wait 12hrs and when we agreed to pay INR 1000/person to issue new boarding passes they again changed the story that we will have to wait upto 5am and if there are any seats left then they will be able to accommodate us.

Such a cheap illegitimate wat to get money out of the customers, this indeed is a new way of flying, firstly by not allowing to board the plane though it was possible. Later, on speaking with one of the Vistara staff members, it was revealed that because you were on a special discounted fare they did all this drama to get more money out of you guys. My mother has cursed your airlines and the people who misled and misinformed us which led to this hardship, from the bottom of her heart. Your airline wont last long. Another magnificent failure of tata after tata nano. About 40 percent of the flight's seats were vacant, that tells the whole story of the awful feeling people get by flying with Vistara.

We were put through unnecessary hardship & stress as a result of the mismanagement, miscommunication, misinforming customer, customer misleading and customer embezzlement. 

It is quite certain that we will never fly again with Vistara even if offered for free, a mismanaged airline and will not recommend to family, friends, colleagues and neighbors.",Domestic,1.0,February 2020,18 February 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

1. The seats in the rear only- Rows 20 and beyond
2.No fresh food- a very poor choice from what you can purchase - basically packaged foods.
3. No change or even UPGRADE by paying the difference on this ticket.

I finished my appointments in Mumbai sooner then expected and came to the airport

"A solid ""-5"" star's without hesitation",IFly Aviation,Bhubaneswar - New Delhi,"Alright, Firstly i was so extremely happy about flying Vistara yesterday (in reference to January 2nd 2020) and i still was until Boarding, Me being a blogger and reviewing flights this was a big chance for me to actually make the best content to put out there for my audience as Vistara is a very blogger friendly airline! But it wasn't even 5 seconds that i was on the aircraft (VT-TNW) which by the way me being an aviation enthusiast knew that this Aircraft wasn't even 15 days old, Upon Boarding i received a very unwelcoming greet and the IFS was doing something else and could,nt care less either!! it wasn't long that i was walking through the Business Class cabin when i hear the Crew member tell me that recording or pictures aren't allowed, Now since when has this started that you guys have come up with such a thing, anyways regardless i went to my seat in Economy and the same happened! The Crew at the overwing exit came to me and asked if i was a blogger i responded saying,"" Yes, i'm an aviation enthusiast"" she went on to explain me the new seat features to which i felt amazing many Airlines lack such friendliness, however before the conversation even started she told me that taking pictures or videos where not allowed (Now weather i get an explanation for this or not i'd like to add that you advertise yourself's to be very blogger friendly and telling a blogger to stop his/her camera work is extremely disappointing) now coming to the service, It was dreadfully slow! The Crew where the last to respond to a passenger call bell even when they saw the light they could'nt care less about responding to it! And the Vistara world IFE wouldn't work on my phone either! However the north eastern Cabin Crew at the back was provably the only one who performed the best and was smiling at the passengers all throughout the flight and was friendly, No one else in the Cabin was smiling or performed the best as her and the other crew at the overwing exit i was taking about? She was extremely casual and unprofessional at all times! A incident even came up when i was waiting to use the washroom and she was saying that,"" What all have you recorded? Could i see the footage?"" now i fully respect the crew and pax privacy and i blur out their faces and i only don't blur out whenever they tell me it's alright. But i felt like a CISF personal was questioning me when i heard that, I was happy to fly that Aircraft which is brand new but the Crew sure where not! When i deboarded i could sense that the Crew just wanted to get raid of me and the other passengers, Vistara has never been great with bloggers lately and i sadly felt it yesterday but don't get me wrong because on the 26th of Oct i flew UK927 to which i absolutely loved the experience so much that the Crew even out staged the world's best Airline Qatar Airways when it came to the experience! And they definitely out staged the Vistara's service standards to such an extent that it actually became unbeatable to compare any Airline with Vistara. But nothing was the same on my yesterday's flight UK788. The Quality was so poor that neither Tata nor Singapore Airlines would have accepted it, If you praise yourself's saying that your the ""only 5 star Airline in India"" then do live up to it or least show evidences!! i know it get's tough to control a company when it's big, But Vistara isn't even this big with a fleet of 40! Look at your Low Cost Competitor SpiceJet! They deserve 5 stars because they have more than 110 Aircraft's and 680+ daily flights and still give personalized and award winning services! With such a rate i fear that Vistara might loose it's 5 star rating this year! Thanks for such a great start to the year Vistara!! And as a icing on the cake JUST LIKE JOSH CAHILL'S FLIGHT REVIEW WITH THIS FAKE 5 STAR AIRLINE I thought that the passenger's privacy might be an issue so I stayed back in the Aircraft since the end and after everyone deboarded I asked the crew once again if I could take some pictures and videos now, She told me to talk to her senior in a very rude and unprofessional manner with no luck I came back to get my stuff and deboard and the crew member then told me,""Are you done?!"" And the tone showed the fact that she didn't like working her job or with this Airline who was once a 5 star Airline likeliness to recommend 0 I'd rather give them a -10 stars if I had that option!!!!! And I know for a fact that Vistara doesn't pay attention to reviews either they just hire someone to copy and paste already written text by just replacing the surname time and again and the review is brushed beneath the carpet",Domestic,1.0,N/A,11 February 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

"So far, two different flights and all I have is good to say",Gaiabeliever,New Delhi - Bangkok,"Have flown Vistara twice now, both times were excellent experiences. No problem with baggage, dead-on, on-time flight, courteous service, overall, worth paying the extra for. In fact, MORE than worth paying the extra that they want for a flight considering the pain in the a** that the other airlines can be and are much of the time; lost baggage, stolen/opened baggage, delayed flights (missed connecting flights), rude service people, you name it, I've had it with the others. Not with Vistara, so far, only positives with this airline and hope they keep the business model they have now. One note, I'd left my phone on a pathetically slow charging station, went through the gate, down the loading ramp to the plane, then realized I'd left it. Running back up the ramp in a panic, the security people refused to let me out, but relayed to the Vistara counter people what the panic was, one of their counter people ran to the charging station and started lifting phones until I waved madly through the glass that it was mine. When he brought it to me, he insisted that he see me unlock the security on it before he would let me go with it (exactly as he should have done!), I did and all were happy.

HOW VISTARA HELPED MY GIRLS TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT…,Ravish B,Hyderabad - Mumbai,"As a father of twin girls who are 10 year old, I want them to be independent and as an initial step towards that, I decided to send them to my sister’s place in Mumbai. I gave call to my cousin in Mumbai that I am planning to send girls alone via flight to Mumbai and about to book a flight either in Indigo or Spice jet. He recommended booking in Vistara as they are rated number one and girls would have a wonderful experience. Well going by the strong recommendation I decided to go ahead booking with Vistara and let my girls get pampered. 

At the booking site, I couldn’t find an option of booking unaccompanied minor. I called their customer support for assistance and I was completely surprised by the solution I received. “Sir, there is no fare difference between the Child and Adult. So you can book in the adult and fill the form of unaccompanied minor and send them across by paying the fee of 2500 each.” I did not want to take a chance on this, but I dint want my girls to miss the premium experience of Vistara which was recommended by my cousin. So, I decided to reach out Vistara on twitter on 4th Jan 2020 where they replied me with the link to book the tickets with their young stars program. Again an Adult was mandatory and reached out to Vistara again on twitter and they arranged a call back to assist me in booking and the tickets were finally booked! But I wasn’t able to pay the unaccompanied fee due to reasons best known to them. I was pretty excited for my girls to experience the hospitality of Vistara. 

The flight was on 11th Jan 2020 at 8:20 AM and we reached at HYD airport counter at 6 AM. At the counter the entire staff was clueless not only on they have unaccompanied minor scheduled to travel but also on the procedure. It took 40 mins for them to generate the boarding pass though all the forms in quadruplicate were made available to them along with tickets and id. Till then we all were standing in front of their counter. They took girls inside and asked us to come back again at 8:30 AM to take the form as they do not give the form now incase if the flight gets cancelled. I reached there at 8:30 but received the form at 8:50, as the staff was clueless again on procedure. I requested at the counter that I wish to make the fee payment of unaccompanied minor from BOM – HYD as suggested on twitter that both the payments can be made over airport counter. They were clueless and suggested that I make the payment either at BOM or over online thru customer care support.

Girls landed at BOM and were handed over to my cousin who was there to receive at the airport around 10:45. I was shocked that my girls were not offered a meal and one of my girl asked if they had to purchase the meal. I immediately called the customer care and enquired if my girls were entitled to get complementary meals on board to which they said yes and said they would enquire on what went wrong. I did not want to be prejudice till I get to know where the things went wrong. So, as suggested at airport to get the payment online for the unaccompanied minor from BOM –HYD, I requested if they could assist me with the same. The executive denied. I insisted please give me the same in writing or raise a complaint and share me the reference. He said he cannot do this even and I requested to transfer the call to the manager as I wanted to resolve this issue. The manager said that I need to write an email for the same then I asked them the basic question of having this customer care number. Since I was not satisfied the response and I had other priorities to attend, I asked for my reference I would like to record this call and asked the permission if I could. The manner I got the response post recording was completely different and positive. The complaint was also lodged and also got assurance of assisting me to make the payment. 

I kept on following up on twitter for making the payment and at least make sure that the experience for my girls on the onward journey from BOM – HYD is pleasant and memorable. 

On 13th Jan, I gave a final attempt to make the payment from my end for unaccompanied minor and reached Vistara thru twitter. This was basically for 2 reasons. 1) I did not want my sister to pay for this and 2) I wanted to make sure that the airport staff is aware that unaccompanied minors are travelling with them. I got a call from Vistara at 11:23 PM asking me on what assistance is required and I asked them to give me a call any time from 9 AM next day as I was already asleep. Nothing happens till 4:15 PM and I get a call from Vistara stating sorry Sir, we were unable to assist you to make the payment and the payment is done at the airport. I assumed my sister might have made the payment as they had reached the airport by that time.
I get a call from my sister at 5:48 PM saying that they have taken girls inside and informed me that they are staying though they have been asked to leave. I enquired if they got a copy of form they submitted and payment acknowledgement which she denied and said that they said the payment has already been received. We both were confused as neither of us had made the payment. I asked her to stay at the airport till you get the form signed which you submitted.

I reached out to Vistara on twitter to contact me immediately. I got a call and explained them that neither of us have made payment and no acknowledgement of girls been given while they are taken inside. At 6:03 PM I get a call from my sister that now that are asking for payment and she is able to see the girls standing in the airport all alone! My sister again calls me at 7:20 PM that she finally received the acknowledgement and the girls have boarded the flight and she insisted to raise a complaint as the entire process is in mess. 

Girls arrived safely at Hyd. And I enquired on what all they did in BOM and airport. Here is their experience with Vistara!

“While going to Mumbai, the support staff was really good and friendly. We were the last one to board the flight and since we were given out seats in the 3rd last row of the flight we fell asleep, probably that’s why we were not served the food. We were pretty hungry as we were last to get down from the flight and it was a pretty long morning for us. While come back to Hyderbad, it was good that we were early to airport. We were taken inside by an uncle who just kept on telling us 2 mins and all of a sudden he vanished and one aunty came and took us for check in. During check in she asked if the payment is done and we were clueless as we are not aware of this. Then she called Fui (Aunt) to make the payment then the aunty made us go thru all the process and this time we got seats in front and were among the 1st to get meals. The meals were not so great it was like puff, so I just ate the outer layer and asked for coffee since we were hungry, but coffee was black so dint like the taste and then we opened the boxes we got to eat. Upon arrival we had to take the bags ourselves from the belt but in Mumbai one uncle helped us with baggage.” 

To Sum up:
Vistara doesn’t care for kids/minors as they are not decision makers in choosing the airline. They are pathetic in handling kids and providing them with wow experience. Kids/Minors are least priority for them. I should have understood this while booking the tickets as they do not support unaccompanied minors as other airline do on their website. I paid more than 50% of the entire ticket cost to Vistara for this experience apart from 20% premium for choosing them over other airlines. But I thank Vistara for what all has happened, from parents point of view this turned my little girls in to young matured girls who can now control their feelings when things are not going the way they expected. They can resist hunger and stand tall all alone in patience in an unfamiliar location waiting for things to fall in place without panicking!

This I did and the check in agent very kindly and efficiently booked my hand luggage onto the flight. She would even have retrieved my main case and allowed me to pack the duty free in it but luckly enough we able to sort the problem with the hand baggage.

"Being Singapore Airlines connected, expected much better, sadly a let down",ssbhat2018,Mumbai - Singapore,"High expectation were met with downright average service and less than average food. UK105 had a very hard working Air Hostess, called Roxanne. She was the brightest spot in the travel. Took care of more than a share of her workload and was very polite, cheerful and helpful. She was also called upon when there was an emergency on board, when a elderly gentleman blacked out, when going to the toilet.
UK106. The food was not bad in taste but in variety and preparation. How can you have 2 choices of vegetable slurry (dal makhani & corn spinach) sandwiching rice. There was too much of the vegetables to finish. The plastic cutlery served had plastic wrapping which took time to tear off. Why of why, cant a notch be given to make it convenient ? No fruits. While I had dozed off when the dessert was served, I had to request the air hostess to give me the same. Overall, the food choice, selection was lower than a budget airline.
While this may sound a bit outrageous, I cannot but comment on it. The air hostess dresses or uniforms looked as if they were 1 or 2 sizes larger than needed. The styling was also one of the worst amongst Asian Airlines.
Attitude of the air hostesses were also a bit aloof and requests were met with frosty serving. Certainly not Singapore Airlines genes.

Nice experience,Vedang1990,Mumbai - Singapore,Tried Vistara for the first time Mumbai - SG flight. Had high expectations as they are partners with SIA and wasn’t disappointed for the service provided for the given fare. Departure and landing was on-time. Web checkin was smooth. Leg rooms were ok but they had premium economy seats which have better leg rooms (maybe next time). In flight entertainment is available but you need your own smart device to connect and watch. Food was decent as well (cheaper boxes and cutlery). Blanket was provided as well. Overall it seemed like a nice cheaper substitute for SIA.

Horrible Horrible time taken for baggage delivery,Parmjit2006,Goa - Mumbai,We boarded UK842 from Goa to Mumbai. The chick in was fantastic. Unlike Mumbai where you find porters just loitering around the porters at Goa helped us at every step. Flight and food was ok. BUT when we landed at Mumbai it took one hour forty minutes for luggage to arrive that is double the time of entire flight. There was no staff around. After half an hour a young guy comes but has no clue what to do. After another half hour a senior comes but just stands there with no action. Guests were frustrated. An elderly gentleman was tearing his hair off as he had another flight to catch. I even asked if we can go and they will send the luggage but no response. Shame on the airline and I hope the airline will take the manager of Mumbai airport to task. As I had written in my earlier review the porters at the check in just stand around and do not help with luggage.

Horrible Experience with Delayed Luggage,Allena M,New Delhi - Bhubaneswar,"I took a domestic flight within India and when I arrived in my destination my checked bag was missing. 

I was informed that my bag was detained in Delhi (my origin point) because the x-ray showed something that appeared to be a prohibited item. I had no such item in my bag. Apparently they could not open my bag to check it without my permission. But instead of Vistara asking me for permission while I was waiting for my flight, they just held my bag. 

Vistara tried to get me to sign a waiver that I would indemnify them for any damage and allowing them to open my bag and dispose of anything they found inside that was prohibited. 

They then told me my bag would be on the next flight that evening. It is now they next day and I still do not have my bag or any update. I have called Vistara many times but each time they claim they cannot give me any information or any timeline of when I will get my bag. Now they have stopped answering the phone.

Now I am at a wedding in India without any of my belongings and with no guarantee I will ever get my bag back. Vistara has been incredibly unhelpful during this very stressful experience.

OK flight,Raja R,New Delhi - Amritsar,"My wife & I flew Delhi-Amritsar on Vistara’s economy class. Check-in was smooth. Boarding was confusing - there were supposedly three queue’s for boarding - business class; back rows; and front rows. We were in the second segment and were waiting for announcement of our turn to board. In reality there was no such process and everybody boarded at their convenience - this was strange.

As I passed premium economy seats to head to my seat in Economy, I felt that there was very little difference between this and the economy class. The combination of leg room and seat design is such that I couldn’t hold the magazine at a convenient angle & distance so as to be able to read - and this is when the person ahead of me had not reclined his/her seat. This is a real issue. To my good fortune, the seat next to me was empty and so I turned sideways and was able to read the magazine. We were served sandwiches and it wasn’t good.

Don’t fly Vistara,elisabetta m,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"In summary, our experience was one of no service, absolute lack of transparency and respect for passengers, and in fact deliberately misleading behavior. My family and I were booked on the 5:40 pm flight from Bangalore to Delhi. 20 minutes before the scheduled arrival, the captain informed passengers that - due to fog in Delhi- we would be rerouted to Ahmedabad. After waiting for couple of hours on the plane on the tarmac, without any further information on next steps, we were deplaned. Staff on board - from the captain to the crew- were not able to give us any information. There was no Vistara ground staff to receive us and we were left to wander in the airport not knowing what to do - whether our luggage would be taken off the plane, whether we would be put on another flight...complete uncertainty! In the end, after finding some ground staff by chance, we were told our checked in luggage would be kept on board and given a new boarding pass with a departure of 3:00 am - no gate. We were basically given no choice and kept hostage in the airport - no offer to put us up in an hotel or otherwise make up for the considerable inconvenience. Again, 3 am passed and no information whatsoever from Vistara. We had to go around the airport and find the manager, and after much pressure from irate passengers, he reluctantly disclosed that the new pilot would only arrive in Ahmedabad around 4:30 am and the flight to Delhi would only depart after that - maybe. Vistara staff must clearly have known this  all along and lied to us. This behavior is unacceptable and substandard - Vistara showed complete disregard of our rights as passengers.  I can understand that weather conditions are beyond the airline’s control, but mitigating the impact on passengers with appropriate standards of service, consistent communication and transparency is not.

This meant we could not make our connecting flight (also Vistara - booked as a single trip). We were offered no apology and no attempt was made to rectify the situation.

So our options were really reduced to half cooked meals like rajma chawal, poha, upma etc (not even sandwiches) where you put hot water to cook and leave it for 5 odd minutes.

There are 2 classes to look onto good customer service first is the standards set by the Airline and other being the actual service, Although I definitely have to say that this was just unacceptably exceptional level of service! Right from the Check In till the baggage Belt nothing felt like the standards set by Vistara, Instead it felt like the service was beyond 5 stars!! I'm just so thankful for this beautiful Airline quite honestly 10/10 for the check in team who actually went out of their way to see a smile on my face now coming onto the flight experience - After Boarding the Vistara's (ex Jet Airways) Boeing 737-800(WL) Everything was actually so amazingly good that I was blown away out of this world!! UK927 from DEL-BOM Operated by VT-TGE on the 26.10.19 Quite honestly it didn't even feel 5 star it actually overshoot that rating and if I was the one to give that Crew a rating I'd probably give 12/5 stars quite honestly because they deserved it, Every single person won my respect and love wish that every single Vistara Flight had Dimple, Pawanpreet, Qaiser, Pragya and Komal and all the other Ground Personal if Vistara's reading this review right now and they actually listen to what their Passengers say I would with all my heart urge them to make them trainers if not the Ground Crew, The Cabin Crew definitely has to I still do wish that every single Vistara Flight would be operated by the exact same ground and flight crew!!

"Vistara International operations are a mess, domestic is great....",Gaurav126in,New Delhi - Singapore,"This was a surprise as domestic Vistara flights have been the best but International experience was a complete mess.
First, the check-in, the staff was either ill-trained or had no idea on certain things and took almost 45 minutes to clear 6-7 passengers. Could be a bad day. Next, the business class that I was about to upgrade was a sheer surprise as I dont expect it to be just more spacious seats on a 6 hour flight. Felt happy that I didn't spend money on it. 
The next one was a bumper, a 6 hour flight entails one meal that also is ridiculously less in quantity that a normal person can't feel fulfilled. I have traveled throughout the world and frankly Qatar, emirates or BA does a better job even on shorter flights of about 3.5 to 4 hours, leave aside the longer ones. The entertainment system (wifi based) is so limited in options that you would rather look out of the window only. When Vistara has to compete with all the International airlines, these things have to be better if not the best, at-least. While coming back, they ran out of veg options. Someone's jain food was given to someone else. LOL. All in all, I would say, Internationally, Vistara has a lot of ground to cover.

VISTARA ~A NEW FEELING,Arshad H,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Flying Vistara has given me a new feeling. The suave, svelte, satisfying service is quickly hitting the turbulence of becoming bigger. The real complaint is outside the Airbus 320 and its hostesses who remain as they were...charming and attentive. 
The turbulence is of size. Hastily recruited ground staff, loaders for luggage who are taught nothing both loading and unloading, minimalist training to handle delays, and politeness which are euphemistically told are due to operational “congestion” and worst, on a significantly delayed flight from DELHI, usually, the PRIORITY luggage, like mine was “last bag on bay”. Thrice. 
No wonder another passenger on a different sector has given a 1 star. Another 2 star. In December. 
All airlines the world over take off with aplomb. It is when the foggines of the ground staff appears that the level of service starts descending. Which is where good management keeps the flyer happy and secure.

Flying (or trying to fly) Vistara has been a nightmare,xavpinon,New Delhi - Bagdogra,"Flying Vistara (or trying to fly Vistara) has been a nightmare.

We arrived 1 hour 30 minutes before this domestic flight. A first check-in counter sent us to a second check-in counter where we queued again, which sent us to a third check-in counter where we queued again, which sent us back to the second checkin counter. There seemed to be a problem but everyone looked a bit embarrassed to tell us. Finally, we were told that the checkin time had been exceeded !

We were directed toward a ""manager"", some kind of apparatchik chatting with a colleague in the middle of the terminal. He looked annoyed when we came to talk to him and quickly got rid of us by finding us a powerless assistant to talk to.

We finally learnt that we had been overbooked, which is surprising as we arrived pretty early. The assistant told us ""good news ! you'll get a full refund !"" whereas it was obvious that we were not going to pay for a service we did not get. We suspect they overbooked foreign passengers rather than Indians. Apparently, it happens everyday and it was no surprise for the staff.

Vistara made things worse by refusing to buy another companies tickets because they were too expansive. We finally bought a new ticket at our own expense and wasted a full day of holiday.

Extremely uncomfortable flight.,funnz,Goa - Mumbai,The legroom was very very less compared to any low fare flights. The seats were very small. For a person of good built and stature its torturous to sit through it. Also the guy sitting in front had a tough time as he was travelling with an infant and he had no place to even open his pantry tray as there no space with the infant in the arms. All the flight procedures were rushed through so they could start the food and beverage service asap. For such a short distance flight it is a nightmare for the flight attendants to serve everyone and then collect the trays back on time. With a lot of time wasted on serving individual glasses of water to every passenger I could actually feel the agony of the attendant. They also ran out non-veg meal much to peoples dismay as they had to settle for veg. Food was ok nothing much to write about. Hope they work on the flight quality and service further.

"Late....as usual, disappointing experience",Ajay Kacker,Lucknow - New Delhi,"First things first, while I have been an ardent supporter of Vistara, recent experiences have been little to write home about.

Nevertheless, I shall pen down my disappointments

Took the 5:50 pm flight from Lko to Del.

Flight late by an hour and announced that only 35 mins late.

Usual reason of congestion from Delhi given. Surprisingly all other flights like Indigo, spice etc didn't seem to get caught in the air traffic congestion.

Seats too seem to have been adjusted recently since I seem to find lesser space between the seats.

Snacks were only veg sandwiches! Maybe then Air India is a better option!!!

Air stewardess had to serve water in glasses to all passengers. Why not water bottles atleast for the short duration flights. Air stewards can barely manage to serve all passengers before the landing announcement is made.

Quality of the cole slaw sandwich needs improvement.

Boarding at Lko airport is always chaotic. Why have the 3 different lines when the seat / zone wise boarding will not be followed ??

Flying in Vistara,Ravi Venkatraman,Singapore - New Delhi,"Though I am a big fan of Vistara ( Tata & Singapore Airlines JV) in their domestic segment, somewhat I am not too happy with their Internatinal route operating to Singapore - Delhi. The primary reason being the choices of menu catered in this route. First of all, which airlines on earth serves Lunch in place of breakfast.  When I asked about it, the explanations given by one of the crew was - we got a feedback from passengers that the breakfast served was insufficient, therefore they shifted to Linch ( not that the lunch was great though).  With a little bit of persuasion I have to opt for a little later when needed services category placing a demand for coffee only for the time being was met with a high resistance. Normally Vistara crew are all smiles and extremely good at handling passengers. ( At least my experience of dealing with them being a platinum class flier in Indian Skies) but somewhat the crew in the flight weren’t warm.

We had to make our own efforts to request passengers to jump the queue and also get a buggy. Eventually we could barely make it to the gate and to our surprise found the counter staff with intimation on the late arrival of the flight, as if her counterpart in the ground staff had not kept her in the loop .

Wonderful airline but worst customer care experience,Anirudh_Anand,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"I had booked vistara flight from Bangalore to Delhi return onward on 4th November, 2019 and return on 5 November 2019. I had initially booked on economy class and purchased a confirmed upgrade since I had injured my foot. To my surprise the amount was debited from my account and there was no response from either vistara or option town regarding my payment. I called several times and the customer care executives put me on hold for 20 - 30 minutes each. After having a harrowing experience with 4 of them doing the same thing, I finally got through to one of them who registered my complaint and assured me of priority redressal since I had injured my foot.

Until the date of travel I did not revise any call back. I called again to the customer care number and was informed that there were no seats available and ""if i wanted the money would be refunded"". This statement was made by the manager of optiontown Mr. Joe.Vistara executives also repeated the same thing.

I received my refund but it is strange that They said no seat available when I paid for confirmed upgrade and not stand by. ultimately I had to fly in economy with a broken foot despite taking precaution from my side to purchase confirmed upgrade.

The customer care executives are terrible. Considering the same I wrote complaints to custrelations@airvistara.com and other than getting an automated response that they will get back in 72 hours I have not heard anything from them. It has been three weeks now and there has been no response from Vistara about my email complaints. Customer care with air vistara is the worst experience you can have.

made 5 hours in a B737 tolerable...,mostlyharmless,Singapore - New Delhi,"Morning flight SIN-DEL. Check-in was at Terminal 3, however, we were transferred by bus to aircraft (which was parked in bay between T2 and T4). This necessitated a long bus transfer, which is awkward for those with lots of hand luggage. Aircraft was B737-800 (transferred from Jet Airways) in 2 class configuration. Friendly crew on boarding. Seats were standard economy, fitted out in purple and grey. No data on seat pitch, but felt like 30"" or 31"", which means adequate but not generous. No in seat USB power or IFE, although this could be streamed to personal devices via wifi. The saving grace was the flight was probably only 30% full, likely due to this being a new service, so there were many seats empty which gave the impression of much more room. A warm towel service was given before takeoff, together with a menu card (in economy!). Meal service commenced pretty quickly after takeoff, with complimentary wine available also. An unexpected delight was ice-cream for dessert. Just prior to arrival, a short drinks service was carried out. Crew were generally pleasant throughout, only slight grudge was the insistence that iPad's couldn't be used on landing. We arrived on time, and again, no aerobridge service but were transferred by bus into DEL airport. Overall, good inflight service, reasonable food (with ice-cream!), but I would be a bit hesitant to travel on a 5 hour flight on a B737 narrow-body if the flight was full.

Where did Vistara lose my bag?,SChopra,New Delhi - Goa,"I and my husband flew from Delhi to Goa on October 23 (UK 847), and one of our checked bags was not delivered to us, and the status of the bag is still not available after 9 days. We have repeatedly followed up with the Vistara staff, but Air Vistara does not seem to be taking this up very seriously. 

When we had initially requested for video footage to be reviewed on the day of the incident, we were lied to by Air Vistara who said that one of their staff has seen the video but it was hazy and hence the bags on the belt were not clearly visible. On repeated follow-ups all we were told is that there is no update.  When we returned to Goa airport on Oct 27 for our return flight to Delhi we took up the matter strongly with Air Vistara staff and the following facts were established:

1. No Air Vistara staff had viewed the video footage- just that the security staff told them that the video is not clear so they clearly had lied to us.
2. No formal request was made to review the video footage by Air Vistara - the security staff said that permission was required from the Airport Director and none have been sought so far

We agreed with the Air Vistara staff that they would take the following steps:

1. Formal request to be made to airport director to view the video footage
2. If above efforts were not successful a police report would be filed
3. If video footage or other information revealed that the bag was misplaced in Delhi then a formal report to airport security and a police report would be filed in Delhi.

Subsequently we received an update that Air Vistara staff finally saw the video footage - which now was stated to be quite clear ! - and the bag was never on the baggage belt. They also said they have informed their Delhi office about the same. We asked for a copy of the communication but have not been provided with the same.

Air Vistara is responsible for our delivering our bag back to us; if it has disappeared from a secure environment like an airport we expect that they will file formal reports with airport security and the police in order to satisfactorily discharge their responsibilities. This only leaves us wondering how safe are our checked in bags with the airline if they are not yet able to trace the whereabouts of the bag.

Overall we are very unhappy with the customer care - no sensitivity or sense of urgency is exhibited or serious efforts made, considering that a customer’s festival holiday has been spoiled.

SHAMELESSLY!,jaideep,Goa - Mumbai,"whether it is reward points translating into free flights or upgrades, the senseless interpretation of its own rules is something of a SHOCKER! the airline issues u free flight tickets, in association with a Pvt bank known for its multiple scams, with a limited validity (acceptable), but has pathetic connections to other city from Ur point of origin (UNACCEPTABLE)!!! them some joker from the CEO's office calls u to ""help"" and instead of correcting the gross mistake and re-validating the tickets, tries to con u into using ur open tickets and vouchers for a flight and that too at a time and flight not convenient to u.. upgrade vouchers are useless as most flights have only 2 classes and u cannot be moved up from economy to business because somewhere on their pathetically limited flights, they also have premium economy (joke)!!! with all this fraudulent ideas the airline manages to cheat u out of Ur vouchers from destinations like goa-Mum or vice versa.. also did u know the airline sells full service tickets and zero refreshment tickets at a difference of ₹100 and the  tries to sell u food onboard for ₹400/- 🤣",Domestic,2.0,N/A,29 October 2019,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Boozy passenger in the next seat,Ashok M,Bangkok - New Delhi,"I thought I had made the right choice by choosing seat 7B and would get some time to spread my legs. The pilot announced boarding over and I shifted to the vacant seat 7A. But just as the aerobridge was being detached in rushes a young man with an open can of Singha beer in one hand and a cell phone in the other. He tried to change to the aisle seat (reason became clear later) but refused te exhange with my middle seat. He was cursing into his cell phone in rustic Punjabi planning his liquour purcahes at the Delhi duty free on landing.  No sooner had the captain switched off the seat belt sign, he jumped over us and literally ran the whole aisle to the rear toilets shouting 'hato hato ' - as if his bladder would burst, if delayed. Seeing his condition, 7C shifted to 7A to allow him disturbance free access to the toilet.
Relieved, he dosed off and missed the snacks tray when the young hostess came around. On getting up he realised he had missed out on the free drinks and started badgering the hostess ( almost in tears) for endless rounds of Red Label, soda and even 'moongphali'. Two airhostesses plied him with five drinks ( this is at 4pm) after which he again slumped into his seat.
Come Delhi, his cell phone again came to life and he again let off a string of Punjabi 'gaalis' - this time his arrangements for buying duty free booze had fallen flat as his financier had already pushed off from the airport !

A first time for me - super service - pity about the delay...,Eyekaytoo,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"This was my first ever experience flying with Vistara, apparently a tie up between Tata and Singapore Airlines. I was travelling Business class between Bangalore and Mumbai one Monday evening recently. 

Things didn't get off to a great start as we were told that our flight would be 20 minutes delayed. In the end we took off 55 minutes late. The seasoned travellers on this route sagely informed me that this was often the case as Mumbai only really has one runway. 

Anyway boarding was trouble free and I found myself in a comfortable business class seat. The plane was a Boeing 737-800. Service was extremely polite and professional. Non alcoholic drinks were offered before take off and, once air borne a light meal was available. That comprised a tiny pot of Russian salad, a fish curry and piece of cake. 

The rest of the flight was trouble free. We seemed to circle over Mumbai forever but eventually landed around 11 in the evening.  

The delay ended up being well over an hour.",Domestic,3.0,October 2019,22 October 2019,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0

I woke up shortly before landing and despite the captains announcement for crew to be seated, they checked with me if I'd like to eat something.

The in flight services are pretty good and the best part is the food provided. They have multiple food option and all the food is equally well prepared as I got to try 3 types of meal.

Pathetic service on ground in Del,Rashmi Rao,Singapore - New Delhi,"We took flight 116 from Sg to Del on 11th oct ‘19. On Reaching Delhi we found that not only our Tas luggage locks were missing from both our bags, the zip on one bag was broken and our bags had been opened also. On complaining to the staff we were told this is normal wear and tear. I still don’t understand how two bags with missing locks and broken zip can be normal wear and tear!! Normal wear and tear on a five hour flight ???? I don’t understand this. 
On top of that the staff is telling us this happens all the time and we should not get so either up. Another reason given by the staff was that the customs must have broken the locks as they must have found something suspicious in our bags during X-ray ..The most pathetic and irresponsible answers an airline could give to its passengers..on the bags being opened the staff had no explanation to give except they kept on blaming customs. When we argued with them on how their explanation is totally irrelevant to what had happened, the junior staff got one senior staff who was only busy on his ph. This senior staff had the audacity to offer us Rs 600 for all the inconvenience caused to us. The cost of one Tas lock is more than Rs 600. We just refused this petty amount and left the airport as we had already wasted one hour on this. For sure I am not going to recommend Vistara to anyone EVER.
 I am not at all active on social media but thanks to Vistara first time I am leaving a review on trip advisor. I am going to leave as many reviews on as many social sites as I can. I am totally motivated to ensure people are careful when they take such airlines. I am disappointed and angry with the treatment meted out to me.

It’s called robbery, stealing and looting money from people.

WOW!!!,jameswW6741PS,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Mumbai,"Brand new plane. Flight crew best I have ever seen at any class on any airline. I had a cheap seat and was treated like a king. You could literally eat off the floor! The crew was so attentive.  One little example, before they dimmed the lights on the plane they went up and down the aisle and turned on the over head light of anyone who was reading. The difference between Air India and Vistara was like night and day. I will refuse to fly anyone else in country going forward.",Domestic,5.0,N/A,27 September 2019,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Great Service, Attentive Cabin Attendants",Amit.Tokyo,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"It was my seventh flight on this sector in 2019. I have been shuttling DEL-BLR-DEL due to work. Overall I like the services offered by Vistara. I would say the inflight experience depends on the cabin attendants who serve you during the flight. There were a couple of trips where  I felt the service was average; however, in most of the flights, I experienced outstanding service.

Special Mention:
In the flight I took from Bangalore to Delhi, a Cabin attended named Pema served me and her care for passengers was outstanding. 

Check-in at Airport:
Smooth as always. The ground staff are experienced to handle passenger queries.

Seats:
Seats were quite lovely, and there was sufficient leg space.

Meals:
Just one word - Delicious.
Vistara serves hot meals during the flight. There were options for vegetarian and non-vegetarian.  Hot and cold drinks were also available. I had lassi, and it was perfect. Vistara also serves Starbucks coffee in the flight.

Take-off and Landing:
Very good. The touchdown was smooth.

Baggage Collection at Airport:
At times, I have seen priority baggage arriving late at the belts. 

Overall:
Good experience and professional services offered by Vistara.",Domestic,5.0,September 2019,22 September 2019,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
India’s Best Airline. Period,Navin Kumar Askaran,Chennai (Madras) - New Delhi,"Vistara is truly living up to great services experience and it proudly holds the tag of being the best airline in India.

Terrible service - once again,Prowander,New Delhi - Amritsar,"Today, 20 September, was another example of Vistara's terrible service.  

We purchased round-trip tickets from Delhi to Amritsar.   We purchased Premium Economy to Amritsar and Business on the return flight to Delhi.

After we purchased the round-trip tickets, we found out there is no Vistara lounge in Amritsar.  We are clearly getting cheated out of the full benefits of the business class tickets.   

When we checked in for the first leg of the trip in Premium Economy, the flight from Delhi to Amritsar was delayed by one hour.  Since we knew Vistara was cheating us out of lounge access on the return flight, we ask if it was possible to get access on the current outbound  flight.  This question completely confused the agent who was checking us in.  She eventually called her duty manager by the name of Quamar.  Ms. Quamar was basically useless.  She claimed to understand the situation perfectly but said there was nothing she could do to make the situation fair.  Simple compensation in the form of complementary lounge access in Delhi was completely out of the possible options.  Ms. Quamar, the duty manager, was totally useless in resolving a very simple problem    

It's employees like Ms. Quamar who reinforce the reason I don't fly Vistara on a regular basis.

Vistara's Moto of ""fly the new feeling"" is meaningless when they have employees like Ms. Quamar who know nothing about customer service.

Instead we used our Priority Pass and went to Plaza Premium Lounge in the Delhi airport, which is definitely superior to Vistara's pop-up lounge in Delhi airport.  We know, we've been to Vistara's lounge on a prior trip.",Domestic,1.0,N/A,20 September 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
WORSTEST EXPERIENCE,sanyukta123,New Delhi - Raipur,"This is the worst airline ever. Rude staff and super unprofessional. Will just not recommend anyone. 

Their team is all a totality of human crap who have no manners how to deal with passengers. 

Waste of time and money. I would like to specially mention this guy Amitav Rawat who is apparently on some senior position he doesn’t deserve. 

He was rude and was getting pleasures by troubling passengers. 
We were asked to offload the flight as we reached late at the boarding gate by 1 minute. He kept on arguing for the next 15 mins instead of getting us on the flight. This was all thanks the Vistara Staff who were of no help and didn’t provide us any intimation. The delhi T3 airport was superly crowded which led to delay in security and we happened to reach 1 minute late. 

And the worst of all Vistara being super non considerate of it.

New for international airlines,yash0909,New Delhi - Bangkok,"Travelled to bangkok with my family in air vistara economy!! Must say since its a new airlines flying international sector, please avoid ! Lacks experience of flying to international destinations. 
Food quality was good !! Choice of cusine was not that great !! 
Crew needs to improve !! Just becoz fellow passengers wre behaving weird they forgot good service dont blame them for the way they spoke to some irritating passengers but over looked our needs!! Busy catering to the passengers bugging them repeatedly. 
No inflight entertainment as such. Connect with wifi of the airlines and stream the entertainment only if you have their app installed. 
Fine with that but then atleast have a usb port to keep your phone pr device charged for watching a movie. 
The cabin needs to be upgraded with either usb ports or a personal screen entertainment for a flight more than 3 hrs.

Very Poorly Maintained Aircraft,Sonicgrid,Mumbai - Singapore,"The midnight flight was delayed for more than an hour, with passengers on board, waiting on the tarmac.  Although not the fault of the airline, the aircraft was old and very poorly maintained.  The headrest on my seat was broken on one side and the seat, once reclined, did not return to its original position unless pulled up.  I noticed the tray table of the seat in front was broken and had a strap around it to hold it into place.  The light in the toilet was not working when the door closed and, as you can imagine, halfway into the flight, the toilet was very much not clean.

Seats can be selected with no additional cost which is good.

Very very disappointed because of 2.5hrs delay. How can you delay that much when you are running only two flights per day between cities whereas IndiGo can run 10 flights and still be on time ?

Cabin service was horrible too. They served meals, which was tasty. But they don't serve water with it. So, if you choke while eating it, tough luck. People had to repeatedly ask them for water while eating. What the heck ? Who trained cabin crew on how to serve meals ? How long does it take to pour water in the cup along with serving meal tray  ?  But they would prefer serving coffee and tea after meal than water during the meal.

Coke is not free with meal. You have to pay extra for it.

Overall, my first time experience is horrible with Vistara. Will stick to Indigo as much as possible.",Domestic,4.0,August 2019,21 August 2019,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

A very decent airline with assertive businesses possibilities in India,iRock,Chandigarh - New Delhi,"Hi, I have travelled from Cdg - Delhi a month back via Vistara flight.
I was a very dominant traveler until Jet airways was operating and always avoided traveling with competition airlines.

The crew member was well groomed, flight housekeeping was also satisfactory.

The boarding time was bit high as currently am at base level of membership.

The only thing am concerned with was the flight landing experience😶.
Since I can't consider the same as safe landing.
When I was be-boarding, I specifically asked the Airhostess about the Captain & Co-Captains name since that was the Worst landing exp I had in a decade. At that day the weather conditions seems to be ok.

Our Vistara flight to Delhi was STD around 8.15pm.
On reaching the Vistara Gate 24 which is on the food court level we waited for boarding.
There was no announcements nor any update on the TV Screens. The small boarding screen was displaying the number of some international airlines (later we learnt that this Vistara flight was Code Sharing flight). We waited and waited confused and tired. No communication regarding status of our flight.
There was total chaos at the gate when the boarding commenced. Our seats were in rows 27,28 but as there was no order and people were rushing like for a city bus we fell behind. This caused lot of grief when we got into the plane and reached our seats almost at the rear. The racks were full by then.
Not like reputation of Vistara, the inside service was hopeless. It was further worsened by suspending it due to frequent turbulence.
And worst came when the aircraft docked around mid night at almost end of T3 ( I think that was gate 58 or so) with no golf carts to ferry passengers (old and children) upto the escalators leading to exit.

Boarding was as confusing as any other airline partly due to the panic shown by most of us. On Board was quorious to see the difference between premium economy and economy- Guess it's leg space and maybe the food. The in flight food service was OK.

A CRASHING FALL FROM HEAVEN!,Savison,Mumbai - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Last 26th January I had travelled from Amritsar to Kolkata by Economy class. And I had praised the airline to high heavens and called it the best airline in the country.
So I decided to travel to Kolkata from Mumbai with this great airline. The best thing that I had liked about the airline, for which I had praised it last time was that it had an option of purchasing 'Priority Check-in' for Rs 400, which I had lauded as an innovative idea to help the senior citizens like me. Unfortunately, this time it was not available. Last time 2 meals were served in the economy class, free of charge for the 2 sectors from Amritsar to Delhi and Delhi to Kolkata. This time there was nothing.
I had this rustic couple sitting next to me, the man chewing away betel nut and chuna and making odd noises which were disturbing. It is mentioned by the airline that chewing betel nut is not allowed on the flight, flight attendants did not notice. After some time they took out their Paraths and strong smelly Achar and had their nasta. The flight attendants did not notice. While taking off the guy in the seat in front of me was reclined backwards. I had to point it out to a flight attendant. What I noticed the cabin crew were not attentive towards the passengers.
The whole journey was a disaster for me. The respect I had for this airline  has fallen a few notches for me",Domestic,5.0,June 2019,12 July 2019,3.0,3.0,N/A,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,N/A
Horrible experience,Tanya S,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),Our flight from delhi to kolkata was scheduled at 8.10pm by vistara UK727 on 8th july 2019. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours and we were intimidated about the delay at 6pm when we were already on our way to the airport. As compensation there was no efforts from vistara. I have travelled in vistara before in the same route and we were served dinner but this time even after delay no dinner or any snacks was served on board. Even tea and coffee was called off due to turbulence which was rarely felt . They never resumed the service later. We were supposed to be home by 10.30 pm and we were home at 1.30 am. Really disappointed in vistara for lowering their standards. I chose the airline and paid extra in comparison to indigo for its service.

    Our flight from Kolkata to Mumbai was delayed due to the rainy weather. We were informed of the delay only when we reached the airport. Then we had to scramble around looking for the boarding gate because that was also changed. Finally we found it . There was a lady captain in front of us.

The simplest to interact with airline
The ease of being taken care of by non-overworked, happy, and genuine - not programmed, staff.

Each flight on vistara has been the most relaxing flight I've taken. Its not over done, its not treated like a cheap budget airline for low worth humans.
It genuinely does it well... And makes u feel... Relaxed.

It is, undoubtedly, the airline equivalent of sitting in a non fancy chair in a taj property, with the efficiency whiff of a vivanta... And fairly, paying the price of a Starbucks.

And none judges you for it. Not once in their hands.

Time is money,Ptat14,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"Vistara has started flights between Mumbai and Bangalore reducing the vacuum left by exit if jet airways. But due to the schedule, the aircraft operates between these two cities multiple times in the day. Any airline that operates to Mumbai is sure to get it's schedule thrown to the wind and if it flies multiple times in the day, the problem multiplies exponentially. So all evening flights on this sector are delayed Atleast by an hr. So doesn't matter to what service you offer, if your schedule is all over the place nothing helps. So vistara needs to improve its scheduling and try to keep time.

Diverted flight!,Rakesh Rawat,Chennai (Madras) - Mumbai,"I had a return flight from  Chennai to Mumbai by Air Vistara flight UK 824( hope I got the number correct)on 1st July 2019 which was late in  Chennai itself. Once the flight was nearing Mumbai the pilot announced that runway one is closed and they are arranging alternate runway but nothing like this happened. After hovering for around 35 mins the pilot announced we are diverting to Hyderabad as landing in Mumbai is not possible due to weather conditions and a skid aircraft. All this is fine and understandable. Bad weather is not airlines fault. But after landing in Hyderabad we were in the aircraft for nearly an hour and then  around 0330 hrs we were asked to deplane and just left . No one from Air Vistara on ground to assist us and tell us what next . After 30 mins one gentleman came and he found it very difficult to handle the queries of the flyers.  Not his fault he was all alone and we soon discovered that there are quite a few Air Vistara flights which have been diverted and are parked. I had to wait all night and finally got a boarding pass for a flight at 1130 hrs which later took flight at 1300 hrs. Nothing was offered by the airline but some water and tetra pack juices. Once again  I say bad weather is not airline fault but poor handling definitely is.
A lot is expected of Air Vistara but alas very poor recovery systems in place.

Debateable is business class is worth it,Stephen L,Mumbai - New Delhi,"My first trip with Vistara, it won't be my last as on board service was very good, but I do question the value of business over Premium Economy on the service. You get more luggage and a wider seat, both useful, and the food is good. The inflight entertainment is the same as everyone else and the very grand lounge in Mumbai tells you ""one free beer only, the rest you buy"" with only soft drinks on board. 

Where business class, or frequent flyer gold status, is needed is the airport as the check in was horrendous. It is disorganised and there was one guy on his own trying to keep the flow of customers going. This valiant man was trying to control a lot of people in long queues and they are not patient. In some cases unfairly so, but most were correct in worrying about missing their planes despite being at the airport in good time.

So maybe Business is worth it, as you can get through the madness of check in relatively unscathed. If not, make sure you arrive at least three hours early.",Domestic,3.0,July 2019,6 July 2019,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

The cabin is neat and clean with comfortable seats. They have taken very good measures not to make it too crowded. The premium economy seats are more comfortable and cozy. The passengers are given blankets as well like international flights.

Staff were good except one who served us.. ""phunjolink"" Not sure if I spellee her name correctly..  She was either too tired or not so interested. 
Missed name of your main lady in command.. Absolutely fab body language and fabulous customer service

Few points to make it better for World

Any way we can replace plastic that wraps your cleaned blankets.. It's one time use and sheer crime
Similarly your tea/ coffee stirrer can it be of stick.. 
Water bottles can it be paper glasses.. 

Otherwise..must mention you guys are here to stay and thanks for making us fly royally.. Had been agesssss now..",Domestic,5.0,June 2019,19 June 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

No concept of customer service- held customer hostage to missing their flight,Vinita K,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"We were flying from Delhi to Bangalore to attend a final wedding function on 7th June 2019. We were flying back to Sydney on 9th June from Bangalore and were aware that we would require additional baggage allowance. We purchased the maximum allowed being 20kgs and paid for it. Our credit card was debited for the relevant amount and we used the Vistara website to pre-purchase. At the airport the airline staff said there was no payment on their records. We showed them the screenshot of the payment and our bank statement but to no avail. They passed on the failings of their faulty website to us and we had to pay again (at double the pre-purchase rates) and were told that if we missed the flight that would not be refundable either and we would have to pay again for the flights. We were shocked at being held hostage by the manager on duty. We had no choice but to pay again. We felt unheard, no care for our circumstances. It was all about the money - $300. We have always travelled Vistara when we fly within India but are probably will not anymore given our experience.

An oasis in the Indian skies!,Aman K,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Domestic flying in India off late meant choosing between really poor full service carriers or Low cost carriers. Vistara truly is a breath air offering a full service proposition with the flexibility to tailor your flying experience like Low cost carriers. I upgraded to premium economy on option town for a mere 1500 rupees (20 dollars) and got priority check in, boarding and extra leg room. The check in and boarding process were an absolute Breeze and the aircraft was a sparkling A320neo. Seat comfort was fantastic with roomy seats and noticeably more leg room that was ample to work on your laptop and be able to exit your seat without having your seat mate get up. Inflight service was TOP notch for short haul with a meal that actually tasted like real food and a choice of beverages (something no full service carriers offer in India). The inflight service was friendly and efficient. The entire meal service was cleared within 30 minutes with the crew doing an extra drinks run. To TOP it all, we arrived 10 minutes early. Vistara offers streaming entertainment although the interface was a tad clunky and the content could have been curated better. Vistara would do well to offer inflight wifi. This was probably my only gripe (if I had to be picky). Overall, Vistara possibly delivers the best short haul experience globally. I would totally recommend buying the upgrade to premium economy as such a nominal cost as it makes it a truly hassle free experience. Let’s hope they can sustain the quality and not go the same way as Jet Airways.",Domestic,5.0,June 2019,13 June 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Underwhelming experience!,Multiple_Sarcasms,New Delhi - Chandigarh,"I flew Delhi to chandigarh via G8 106 on 17th May, first time with vistara. 

What an underwhelming experience! 

My flight was supposed to take off 5.10 PM, there was some rain (ten minutes) and the flight got delayed by half an hour. 

There was just 1 lady at Gate 48 to handle the people. 

I'm sure it wasn't a sudden delay, even with the half hour delay someone senior should have been there to assist her. 

Thankfully the crowd was decent, and calm. Irritated as I was but calm. 

Then I got SMS it was delayed to 8 pm! 

The delay could not be helped, not in hands of Vistara, if due to safety it's landed in Varanasi (If I believe the story we got) but there was no service recovery of anykind. 

We just waited till 8 pm, finally took off at 9.10 Pm. (Again, lets say it's not Vistara at fault) 

But the other flights of Vistara and other flights were on time, there was no delay or anything for others. I know this because I saw the status board at the airport. 

Weird how the only flight to be delayed was this. Maybe because it's a small city not Mumbai, Calcutta.. Etc. 

Anyway.. We landed I think around 950 or something around that. 

This situation could have been handled better, but having more people speaking to the flyers... Giving some access to lounge.. Or something. And better grievance handling training for the staff. 

My first and probably last flight with Vistara. Will stick with GoAir.",Domestic,1.0,May 2019,12 June 2019,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Just before 30 minutes prior to gate close, we receive a phone call and called to open the baggage. But airlines security denied to handover the power bank. They simply told, you want to catch flight or power bank. choose one option. I request them I informed at check in counter then why airline officer misguide me ? But no use. I was having plenty of time during check in, no rush, to remove power bank from checked in baggage. 
 It was  first trip with vistara airlines and  in future we never use  again not because that we lost  power bank  because of their misguide and behavior. They are not cheap in price but cheap in customer relationship.

Awful Baggage Experience & Unconcerned Check in staff,Armindo Gonsalves,Amritsar - New Delhi,"We were a family of 4 with children travelling on 9 th May by Flight No UK707 Seat No 25  C,D,E & F
Most Domestic Airlines have a policy of 15 kg baggage allowance  per pax
But Vistara is the only Domestic Airline having a one piece baggage policy which I realized on the Day of My check in at Amritsar Airport 
We had a total of 5 bags weighing 60 ks but when we went to check in we were told that we could only check in  4 bags  as per Airline Policy so we checked in 4 bags weighing a total of  45 kg and went for Security check were we were in for a shock  as one bag which my younger daughter packed had a couple of Jam & Honey Bottles  and we were told it could not be taken in as hand Luggage
The value of the jams & honey was not much but my younger daughter insisted on taking it 
So I went back to the check in counter where  I was told to pay aprox Rs 6000/- for a bag having stuff costing less than  Rs 2500/-
The staff were very rude and non Cooperative and Insisted  on the Amount  being paid 
As i had previously weighed my baggage I knew that my baggage which was checked in Earlier was less than  60 kg but still then the Airline Staff wanted to Fleece me  and as I asked to speak  the Station Manager who did not bother to  come
Later  one staff  took me aside as  It was Quiet commotion  at the counter I then explained to him that as i was travelling with young children and as the children could not manage the weight per bag I had Distributed it so the children could manage handling their own bags 
Vistara Being a Part Of the TATA group I expected some compassion from the staff taking example of the Legendery Mr Ratan Tata who is one of My Idols
but the staff simply refused to listen but later after a lot of arguments  which were witnessed  by a lot of passengers they took into consideration that my total baggage weight was less than 60 kg and made me pay a sum of Rs 500/- as handling fee for the extra bag which could be done earlier without all the Drama

1) Shaheroz Ansari
2) Biswajit Basak
3) Ashish Bardole

Ashish helped me to change me seat to an exit aisle - something which my travel desk misses blocking for me. Ashish was extremely courteous and helped me with a seat of my choice.

I wasn’t keeping too well today. While boarding my flight I requested Shaheroz and Biswajit at the boarding gate (87B) if I can be allowed to board first as and when the boarding for Economy class is announced. They both surprised me by offering to allow me to board as and when Business Class passengers could board. I was amazed at their empathy and spontaneous service. They understood that I wasn’t feeling well and took care of my physical as well as well as emotional needs.
. 

My inflight experience was equally good. IFE Manpreet took very good care of all travelers including me. She was very hospitable. Observing that I want having much to eat, she offered yogurt and tea for me.I sincerely appreciate her thoughts.

Terrible Experience with delayed baggage. Took them more than 5 days to resolve the issue. Team isn’t diligent,28bharathid,Hyderabad - Minneapolis,"#VistaraDelayedMyBaggageFor5DaysAndCounting #InternationalTravelersBewareOfVistara #NoAccountability #Unprofessional #NotDiligent I had an international flight from Hyderabad,India -Minneapolis, a connection with Vistara. My baggage got delayed for more than 5days now. When I call them about the same no one had any clue where my bags are at. They don’t seem to be very diligent about my issue. I had to bounce back and forth calling customer service and airport authorities. I’ve not received my bags yet. 

Here is my full story 1: The flight from Hyd-Delhi got delayed, they’ve put me on different flight and was told by airport authority in Hyd that my baggage will be delayed by 2-4hours I agreed to it Since 2-4 hours wouldn’t have made much difference. Arrived in the states at Noon on June1st. I’ve given them 24hours head start hoping I’ll receive an email. On June2nd when I’ve not received any update I got worried and called Customer service, After a long hold once I got through, I was told that they have to contact the airport authorities of Hyd for any status and the counter was closed(I called during my working hours, with the time difference and all) I’ve asked them to keep me posted once they get a hold of them. 2: Waited another 24hours and yet again I got the same response. June3rd- This time the next day I’ve directly contacted Hyderabad airport authorities myself, they said they have already sent them to Delhi.

3: Since I don’t have Delhi teams number I called Customer service, they created a request/complaint regarding the same and I’ll be contacted with the updates. 
4: I was being contacted by Vistara associate from Delhi team on June 4th he asked me to raise a claim report at my airport which I did on the very same day and gave him the details of the file number 
5: June 5th I’ve called the same guy from Delhi team he said he have to talk to KLM to send my bags.June 6th I’ve called the same guy and he didn’t respond. So I had to call back customer service yet another time only to be told they haven’t escalated the issue since the last I called them was June3rd and couldn’t get a hold of airport authorities to give me anything.

The staff didn’t seem to be really diligent about what they were doing. They sounded like they are in it for just put in the hours and get it over with, no one was concerned unless I constantly stay in contact to get my stuff moving. After calling repeatedly and telling repeatedly that keep me posted, I’ve not received updates. Vistara will run out of business if this is the behavior. Of all the 4times that I’ve visited India never had to face an issue like this. Will never knowingly fly with Vistara. I really want to sue Vistara if I can, for putting me on this mental roller coaster ride and making me sleepless(with all the phone calls to make) and taking up so much time in resolving an issue.",International,1.0,May 2019,5 June 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Airlines started off very well but it seems that that they are not able to cope with the new load factor,SiddharthDhamija,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"Till few weeks back, flying on Vistara was like a breeze of fresh air. However, it seems that with Jet Airways closing down, business travelers are all moving to Vistara and this is something which they are not able to cope up with on a daily basis. Quality of food is going down by the day; Airline staff is definitely not able to manage a sudden rush of people boarding the flight; crew on board looks stressed and over worked. My other issue with Vistara is that they don’t allow checking on to emergency row seat when one does a web check-in. Unlike all other airlines in the world who issue emergency row seats(and checking the physical state of passenger while boarding the flight) during web check-in, Vistara for some strange reasons does not allow this. What this means is that every time that I have to fly on Vistara, I need to be present 3 hours before my flight at the airport so that I can be lucky enough to get an emergency row seat in economy class.",Domestic,3.0,May 2019,20 May 2019,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Anyway we were April, since my husband and I are both above 80 we had opted for wheelchairs. Our baggage was screened, wheelchairs were there to take us for our boarding passes. The staff at the counter were very polite and courteous, they took in all our baggage, we were under weight, and we were free to go for a security check. The boys were also very kind to us. After the check we were taken to the Gate and made us comfortable. When boarding was announced we were given priority, which I found was very amazing. The cabin crew was also very helpful kind courteous and pleasant. The food served was fresh and sumptuous. We are very happy we flew Vistara. On landing at Hyderabad wheelchairs were available and the ladies taking us were also very good and kind. Our return from Hyderabad to Pune on 22nd we experienced the same good treatment all along.

Terrible training or systems communication for cancellation,Chad S,Mumbai - Bengaluru,"You are all aware of the Jet Airways grounding its flights, so one of the legs of my international trips from Mumbai to Bengaluru was canceled. So I booked that leg on Air Vistara on April 20th for the date of June 14th. I was charged $429 with the charge reading Tata SIA Airlines... on my credit card. Since Jet Airways held the rights to all my legs on my international trip, my whole trip to India got canceled. So I called Air Vistara on April 30th to cancel the Mumbai to Bengaluru leg.

Since my fare was a Premium Economy Flexi Fare, the person who spoke to me assured me that there would be no cancellation charges and that I would receive my refund to the credit card. I call AGAIN today, May 2nd, and they have absolutely no documentation of that call on April 30th. Somehow my flight has been magically canceled but with no confirmation email for cancellation (I know my email works since I reset my password for my Air Vistara online account yesterday to make sure it works). 

The person who spoke to me today told me that it was canceled because they did not receive any funds from my credit card. I see the charge bright and clear today for the $429 for 3 passengers charged to my credit card with a foreign transaction fee of $12 and change as well from April 20th, sitting today on May 2nd. 

Now, what I thought would have been an easy cancellation for most airlines for a recent reservation turns out to be a nightmare for me having to spend extra time to dispute the charge with my credit card thanks to Air Vistara's ineptitude. Either, they need their folks to respond with email notifications for every call or have better training for their phone systems to communicate with their database, wherever the problem lies.

Extremely disappointed and mad that I had to go through this!!! Maybe I will cancel directly on their website next time, but who knows if that would work in refunding my credit card.",Domestic,1.0,April 2019,2 May 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Insulting Staff Behaviour in Business Class,Rajesh_in,New Delhi - Hyderabad,"I have reviewed this airline in the past and have always found it to be one of the best in India, and for that matter across the world. Overall service levels have been very good .

Which is why I was taken aback due to the insulting behaviour by one of the cabin crew ( name I did not ask) on my recent trip from New Delhi to Hyderabad UK 899 on 27th April, 2019. This happened in Business Class. 

This happened while I had just boarded the flight and the rest of the boarding was going on. I had just settled in my seat and was going through my phone . I am not sure what prompted this crew member to come to me and accused me of taking pictures of the crew members. I was shocked and taken aback by the tone and the manner in which she accused me. I offered my phone to her and asked her to check my images gallery. She did not check and went back to her boarding duties. 

I have traveled across the world and in multiple airlines ,but never faced this kind of rude behaviour by a crew member. As soon as the boarding was completed , I sought out the cabin crew in charge and complained to her about her staff's rude behaviour. She said that she had already told the staff not to speak in this tone. As the flight took off , the crew member , who had insulted me, came to apologies and said sorry. I told her my issue with the way she spoke to me, which was absolutely not acceptable.

Impressive,HFKtheone,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"I recently took my boss last Sunday on Vistara Prem Eco. Proud to have a full service airline in the country especially since the only other one is Air India. Let me compare:
1) Call center - Vistara may take a little extra time but get yr work done in one go. Air India difficult to connect and they definitely do you several favors by listening to you and you should feel obliged (I'm being sarcastic in case you have not got it). 

2) Vistara check in: Awesome experience. I've checked into to Jet and Air India on biz class. AI as usiual does you a favor. Jet was nice but slightly arrogant, Vistara is friendly and you are glad to be there. 

3) Food: Vistara serves you a full meal Veg and non Veg. AI only Veg on domestic flights

4) Unlike other European airlines, premium eco seats here are really premium eco and very very comfortable. No one else in India has prem eco seats

Good company but poor customer service and complaint resolution,Alexandra B,New Delhi - Hyderabad,"I had a journey from Hyderabad to Delhi. The company is great overall, but on my return flight, I got sick with the in-flight meal few moments after the landing. I wrote to the Customer Service, explaining the issue. And let me say that the reply wasn't really up to the standards they're claiming. 

All I was provided were copy/pasted e-mails saying that they are really sorry (me too btw, being sick for an entire week isn't really the most appreciable thing in the world to experience), but since no one experienced the same symptoms, well to bad for me. Oh, and I should have advised the crew on board, which is a really enlightened advise to say on a short flight (Less than 2 hours). So to recap, they are really sorry, they hope I will book again with them without actually taking really seriously the issue I was reporting. 

So overall it's a decent flight company, until you have a serious issue. Don't count on them to use their common sense to resolve a failure from their side, which is a bit concerning to retain clients.",Domestic,1.0,April 2019,22 April 2019,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0

Recent Experience - Is the Airline going the way of the others?,YourSunshine,Pune - New Delhi,"Flying Air Vistara for me has always been a pleasure.  But recently I have noticed small changes in customer relations.  The last one left me absolutely upset.  I was flying at a time when there was enhanced security at the airport post the Balakot surgical strike and terrorist attacks were expected.  The airline therefore issued an advisory to flyers to carry the very minimum in hand and made an allowance to club the weight permitted for cabin baggage with check in baggage.  Which meant if you are allowed 15 kgs check in, you could add in 7 kgs permitted for cabin baggage and it would be fine to carry 22 kgs check in.  From Delhi to Pune, there was no problem.  However, from Pune to Delhi, it seems the airline staff at the airport had no clue about the advisory or how the weight was to be managed and for one hour the Customer Service Manager would not accept any explanation.  I had in fact double checked with the customer relations helpline before packing if the advisory was still in place and it was ok to check in 22 kgs and the same was confirmed to me.  In fact I had only 19 kgs and no hand baggage.  But this man insisted on refusing to accept my baggage and I felt really humiliated and insulted in front of all the passengers checking in.  I had arrived first at the check in counter and and hour later when almost all passengers were through security, finally the aiport manager made an appearance.  I once again retrieved the advisory and made them both read it and speak to the supervisor at the customer service helpline, after which they sheepishly checked in for me and gave me my boarding pass.  The CS Manager was not one bit apologetic and still did not think he was wrong.  I took up the matter with the Nodal Officer who promised to take action.  It is now over two weeks, I still have not heard from them about what action was taken.  At the end it seems that Customer Relations is only about saying some sweet words to the customer and getting away.",Domestic,4.0,March 2019,29 March 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Great airline when in India 🇮🇳,AdyHughes,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),Couldn’t recommend the airline enough when travelling around India. I travelled in Premium Economy and it was a great experience. Check in was quick with a dedicated desk for business and Premium economy and the staff were friend. We also purchased the lounge for INR600 and it’s worth it for more comfort prior to the flight. The lounge was ok although the service left a lot to be desired. We was in there a hour and not once did anyone come over to us to say hi or see if we needed anything. Good selection of food and drink though and it’s been fitted out nicely inside the lounge. Once on the aircraft the crew were lovely and the service was nice. Would highly recommend upgrading to Premium Economy for the price. The aircraft look lovely inside and it all looks like a very high class cabin. The only down side to Premium Economy is they service the same meal in there as the Economy cabin which is a strange move when paying more but the food was great along with the nice pillows and blankets. Overall fantastic experience with them and would highly recommend. Nice to see India with a great airline!,Domestic,5.0,February 2019,19 March 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Hi Greetings,
This review is basically my experience on one of the best in class airbus services. Flight was on time. Web check was hassle free .Food was good. Seating were clean and spacious. But despite all this why I said Vistara as one of the best, the answer to the question is in the quote by Mr Branson as I quoted him above. Yes it’s the staff what makes everything possible. By making flight soothing n great experience. The crew is well groomed, mannered, and makes every passenger comfortable. I would certainly recommend whenever you are planning to travel through an airbus always prefer Vistara. Because trust is what they believe in. The surety of complete comfort and great services. With the help of top of the class technology and latest Airplanes Vistara is the best in class.

I started my frequent flying with the luxurious travel with Kingfishers and Jet Airways (the Golden Days) and with times had to switch to the Budget airlines for operational reasons.  
The Services offered by Vistara team was a good throwback to the golden days and reminded me that being courteous and polite by the services team do not cost anything but makes the travel experience so much better for the travelers.

Biggest difference was the comfortable seats which made the close to 2.5 hour journey bearable and the leg space felt like a luxury.

"Dependable, Decent Service, My Preferred Airline",ParminderTraveler,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Vistara is my preferred airline for flying within India. Compared to other options available it offers the best service, the fleet is new, generally keeps time, offers an almost decent meal. 
The problem is that like all other airlines it makes it difficult for economy passengers to pick good seats (window/aisle) through web check in. For instance, when I web checked-in, it showed me that all seats are occupied and there were only three middle seats available. When I actually boarded, there were at least 25% vacant seats.
The other thing that I dont like about Vistara and other Indian airlines is that they charge a ""convenience fee"" when one makes an online booking directly from their web site. What convenience are they providing?  There was a time when Airlines has to have physical ticket offices and agents where one went to buy tickets. Now the customers buy the same online without the airline having to maintain the staff and the infrastructure and the customer is made to pay for the convenience that the airline is enjoying. This makes no sense, and I get the impression that the airline is trying to make the extra buck.

2Kgs extra on check in baggage and made me shift to hand baggage,nzvik,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"Wouldn't fly again. 
Vistara had some promotion and Premium economy was cheaper than economy. Premium economy allows 20kg check in bag allowance and 10kg cabin with a laptop extra. I had excess 10Kg for check in so bought it in advance (by the way the 10kg excess baggage cost was as much as the premium economy fare) 
Turned up at the airport and my check in was 33kg and my cabin including laptop was 8kg.  Silly rules - they made me move 3 Kg from check in to cabin - all of it went on the flight anyway. 
I guess common sense can be lacking and they ensured I never fly Vistara again or bother with their premium economy which is just marginally better than their economy.",Domestic,2.0,January 2019,23 January 2019,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Good airline horrible staff,Manoj Kumar,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,"We flew in to Delhi from Kochi with my parents and family. Our flight experience was amazing. Wonderful air hostess and excellent service.

What made me to write terrible review was the experience we had once we landed in Delhi.

My father who is unable to walk needed wheelchair, we had requested this in Kochi were he was provided one. Once we landed I requested same at the gate, staff showed us the list and said there is no wheel chair request for us so we can't get. They told us to go out and we will get vistara wheelchair there at the door.

My father dragged himself out only to find that there is no wheelchair. I found Air India staff carrying wheel chair and I requested him if I can use it? Staff told me to go back to the aircraft door and request Vistara staff to arrange one.

When I went back all hell broke. Staff got very upset at me when I told there is no wheel chair outside and why they let my father to walk that far knowing no Vistara wheel chair service at the door.
Angry ground staff threatened me to call police and beat me up. They told me that they are on duty and can harm my physically. It was the worst experience I ever had.

I came back to the door, requested again to Air India employee to carry my father and at the airport I complained to manager on duty. She took my details, promised me to look at the incident and apologized for the experience we had. So far I have not heard back from her or anyone else from Vistara. 

I made multiple calls to find out what was done in this regards? I sent mails but still waiting for the response.

I am wondering how staff can treat us in such a bad way, how they can force my father to walk who is sick and unable to walk more than 5 feet. Why they don’t think that helping sick person is their responsibility and why they can threaten a passenger with beating and harming physically?

Does this shows Tata Quality? I took Vistara for one reason only, that was Tata name and Quality. 

Totally disappointed at the expense at airport and on management as so far no update or action on my complaint. Seems management don’t care and they are complacent",Domestic,4.0,January 2019,13 January 2019,4.0,4.0,N/A,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0

Mocktails they make is very tasty and you can order more than one.

The seats are comfortable with pillow & blanket in case you need. Overhead storage is more than adequate as the seats are less compared to the economy section. 

The inflight entertainment you can use on the phone provided you have the app downloaded.
By the time you reach the terminal and to the baggage carousel your wait for your baggage to come would hardly be 3 to 4 mins, which is highly appreciated.

Called their customer service the day before to confirm baggage allowances and their agent (Mohit) clearly told me since I was going to DC after a 3-4 day stay in Delhi, the allowance would be 32 Kg per suitcase per passenger. Confirmed with him twice and packed accordingly. Got to the airport and they said that unless I travel on an international flight within 24 hours of my reaching Delhi, the baggage allowance is only 30 kg (total) per passenger!!!! Totally not what Mohit told me the day before. Vistara confirmed the call and admitted that the guy never mentioned the “24 hour” travel rule YET did nothing to accommodate me or my daughter. They ruined our plans to Delhi, messed up my mood and made me
Miss my flight. The manager (Trilok N)was of ZERO use and did absolutely nothing to accommodate us. I offered to pay for half since I would assume some responsibility as I should have checked their website and not taken their agents word, she just stood there and was on her phone and ultimately made me miss my flight. The worst part they just don’t need give a damn. Totally not customer friendly and I would not recommend this airline to anyone. Worst experience in India so far and that too from an airline that advertises themselves as a friendly, new, customer oriented airline. All BS!!

While the check-in, onboarding was smooth, I found that the Vistaraworld App interface was really poor and unresponsive. It seems ages behind what several other airlines seem to offer. The inflight experience was fair on most aspects except the pilot announcements which sounded really bizarre, almost as if the pilot was sleepy or groggy, making his speech incomprehensible. Professional airlines pay a lot of attention to such little things, which Vistara seems to have ignored. The air conditioning was below average and the cabin was warmer than my expectations throughout the flight. The departure gate at the Delhi T3 was quite far too, leading to quite a long walk from the entry to the departure gate.

Lowest Fares with decent Free Meals!!!,Michael,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"Like most Tata Products and Services, Vistara too stands out in the Crowd.

The first thing that delighted me was the rock bottom fare inclusive of Food!!! 
I was initially thinking the food since free might be some packaged chips and biscuits BUT It was a proper Breakfast!!! Loved It and Thank you... 
For travellers like me who cant afford the outrageously priced food both at the airport and in flight, this was a blessing considering that you have to reach the airport min 120 mins in advance + travel time from home to the airport - and the minimum 2.5hr flying time its too long for anyone to not be hungry.

The next was the care taken in design and look and feel of EVERYTHING - from the boarding passes to the Aircraft Body Graphics, Amazing Choice of Colors!! the Brilliant Logo.

After travelling in such crammed aircrafts Vistara was such a blessing, Vistara does not make you feel that if you cant afford expensive tickets you must travel like piled up caged chicken.

Best domestic Indian airline,Charu S,New Delhi - Mumbai,"I had a superlative experience traveling this morning 22nd dec from Delhi to mumbai on UK 975 at 6 am
Due to the delay in entry because of long queues I only made it to check in at 5 am which was the cutoff for bag drop off. When the ground crew  found out they immediately bumped me to the front & checked me in  

They also honoured my international travel the same day & allowed me the 23 kg checkin. Which other domestic airlines make a big fuss of.this is a huge step for an airline & I appreciate vistara for it.

The flight crew was attentive & professional.  And helped me find a spot for my luggage .

Service staff was non intrusive when they gently woke me up for complimentary breakfast 

Everyone wished so smoothly like 1 team. Shout out to all the staff on this flight. You made my air travel so pleasant.

Many many thanks & with gratitude

YES.YES.YES - AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE - AJU AND AKHIL (COCHI) WERE AMAZING,Sarah Moore,Kochi (Cochin) - Chandigarh,"Never written a review for a airline in my life, but had to leave one for this one after the amazing service I received. I was traveling alone in India for business. As a female, this wasn't the most comfortable experience. I had to go from Cochi to Chandigarh to see a vendor so I booked this flight at the last minute. This visit was very important so I deliberately chose this airline over some of the others in the country because I read that this airline was fairly reliable and I couldn't afford a canceled flight. When I got to the airport I learned about the weight limit for carry-ons. I begged and pleaded (like an entitled a-hole when I think about it in hindsight) for them to make me an exception because I had work materials and several other important items that I NEEDED for my vendor visit.. I offered to pay for the bag but they said they really weren't able to allow weight overages in economy class. They could only do so for business class customers. AJU AND AKHIL spent what felt like . hours trying to help me get an affordable business class . We weren't able to find any that were affordable, but they tried just about every thing they could to ensure that my bag was tended to. In the end they put special labeling on my bag, personally escorted me through the baggage process, and did virtually everything they could to make sure my bag made it to my final destination. This really meant a lot to me, given the circumstances. I've never seen service like this at an airline. I am so glad I traveled with them and not another carrier. The actual flight was great - organized boarding, great snacks, friendly airline attendants, and easy flight. This was so comforting and calming to me during a stressful time. Will definitely be flying with them again because I know that their service is impeccable and that if anything goes wrong they will do everything they possibly can to make it right.

They had confirmed the flights, sent e tickets to my email on 29th October 2018, sent another e mail on 10th November 2019 with an offer to upgrade to Business class.

When I phoned Vistara from Sydney, they told me that the flight in that route has been cancelled and there is no other flight by Vistara from Chennai to Kochi. The lady in that enquiry line offered me to cancel the flight for Refund. But even now on19thDec2018, after my enquiry over phone and e mail, I have not received any information regarding the flight cancellation, or cancellation of our booked flights or the status.

The tea served is Wagh Bakri which is a famous brand from North India. I have tried this tea before and liked it and was surprised that Vistara is offering this in their flights.

Best domestic airlines in India,Saumendra Nath B,New Delhi - Ranchi,"Currently air travel in India is cheap and has multiple option. VISTARA is the latest entry into the sky. I extremly happy with their services.  Few reasons, the CV or reward point earning is very fast,  each travel will add the point and it is so attractive that reaching Platinum is so easy for frequent flier. Currently I am gold member and avail airport lounge in many airport. Vistara has exclusive lounge in Delhi T3 airport and it is very high standard. Next is price. It sometime lowest fare among all other airlines. If it is not lowest it become not too high. Next is hospitality, the ground staff, baggage handling and crue members really very positive towards passenger. I had harrowing experience in another domestic airlines who consider travellers like Their servant. Vistara give a class feeling to travelers. Next is food and snaks  which reflect true sense of hospitality. Next interier, it has smart entertentment facilities which has unique experience. finally safety angle. Highest safety which every passenger expect from airlines. The only challenge is tire two cities are not connected. I hope their air network will expand in future.

Best airline for domestic travel,Neeraj K,Mumbai - New Delhi,"This was my 3rd or 4th flight on vistara. I had a business class ticket so there was almost no queue to collect the boarding pass and the security check. I got access to GVK through my boarding pass itself. It's arguably the best lounge in India, though I am yet to visit an American Express lounge for which I have heard only good things. 
For vistara flyers, GVK lounge offers a complementary beer or glass of wine. I chose red wine. 
The lounge is not far from the gate, and I was in the first few to board the aircraft. A complentary mocktail was offered shortly after and we were presented with a menu. I was carrying some reading material, so I decided to read that followed by a quick nap. The air hostess then woke me for the meal, but I wasnt hungry because of the meal at the airport. Still I decided to taste the food a little and food was nice. After the food service, I was asked to choose a beverage and I asked for the much advertised Starbucks coffee. I will rate the coffee as slightly below average but the presentation was good in a ceramic Starbucks coffee mug. it was only 2 hour flight which ended shortly after the coffee.

Delhi to Kochi,nnmn25,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),"A little delayed review but I flew Vistara from Delhi to Kochi in August of 2017, I had booked the flight about a month before and got a pretty good deal as they were running a promotion. The check in process was great we could check in at the New Delhi Metro station and get our boarding passes there. The overall process was simple and quick, plus dropping off the bags at the metro station was helpful. Once we got the Delhi International airport Vistara is at Terminal 3 so its a quick walk from the metro to the terminal (airlines like Indigo and Spicejet are at T1 for which you need to take a bus). Security was quick and once we got to the gate it was pretty fast boarding and the flight took off on time. Unfortunatly there is no in flight entertainment so we had to rely on watching the saved Netflix shows on our iPads and listen to music. The food service was good, there was a selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals plus tea, coffee and other soft drinks.",Domestic,5.0,August 2018,11 December 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

amazing flight n serivce of the contemporaries - the purple king,liferocks24,Mumbai - Amritsar,"though i flew through  by many a flights including those that have merged or gone bankrupt, the memories of good times of flying were back with VISTARA.
 VI-STAR-A is a true true STAR of the skies of the modern day.
the service from check in to boarding to in-flight service was great n polite n promt n hospitable unlike few noisy ones.
having booked a premium ticket for the family the seats quite comfortable with adequate room space.
the magazines were new and the newspapers were in place.
like i said the staff on board was absolutely great.
the food served was from a menu and the food was a mix of everything yes non veg,specially the brownie was great.  
the ambience and decor of the flight was all purple and great.

the flight took off on time and landed before time.
icing on the cake was ,there were two celebrities  on board ,a cricketer and a renowned choreographer cum director .and both obliged for a snap with the family.

there was in flight entertainment with pre -loaded content and one need not  worry but enjoy on one's mobile after logging in and enjoy the flight.

overall a big thumps up to the lavender, the purple star.
yes , the prices are generally high and that coaxes me to look for alternatives though the heart longs to fly by vistara.  thus my next flight is not vistara this time, but may be next time.

Alternate carrier option,XTIAN,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"Being a Jet Airways frequent flyer and the airline being in news for all the wrong reasons, it's only fair to start checking on other airlines at par with Jet Airways.

Hence I decided to take my return flight with Vistara. 

I was originally booked in premium economy but I got it upgraded to Business. However to misfortune, the boarding pass printing machine had died at Hyderabad as well.... it took me forever to get past the check in.... that's twice in 4 days with Vistara at two different airports. What are the odds?

Having experienced that at T3, I didn't let that experience bog me down. And I'm glad I made that choice.

Flight departure/arrival was on time and in flight hospitality and service was exemplary.

Having got past that hurdle, I wasn't expecting much. It's best to expect the least with that kind of experience.

total rip off,Nelson M,Bagdogra - New Delhi,Horrible experience ever. We bough the premium economy ticket as the customer care agent told us we can take 25kg of check in and 10 kg of hand luggage but when we got to airpot we were told other wise. we could take 20kg instead of 25. Everything just seemed like a big money scheme. Vistara airport customer service and ticketing agents at bagdogra airport were not helpful rather they would just chit chat with each other. IMPORTANT LESSON!!! Always record conversation with vistara people they can flip at anytime. I have never been a reviewer but this experience has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I had to vent it. After a long hassle at the ixb the manger Vinod Tamang helped us but after have been gone through the excruciating process in that heat it meant little. Also the Air hostess from del to ixb were not pleasant. Only good thing about our travel was cup of coffee (starbucks).,Domestic,3.0,November 2018,9 November 2018,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

E. In flight Service: The in-house magazine Vistara provids good informative reading. Hot breakfast was served. Bread roll, butter, masala omelette, parsley potato, grilled tomato, mango dahi and coffee or tea.

From the Effortless check in at Delhi Metro. However walk to gates situated far side at IGI may bother some people, the airline may think on that. but that was not a problem for me. 

The Boarding Process was systemetic.
The Aircraft was well maintained and Clean, the seats had amazing comfort and well legroom for a tall person ( i am short btw so lots of space remained). The Cabin  Fragrance was charming.

The Best thing was the Food. Mouth Watering and Delecious. 
Never expected such amazing food in an airline.

The Service, Crew was exceptional.

The Ticket Fare was low compared to other Full Service Carriers on the sector.

All these add to An Excellent Experience.

Have to say that it was amazing experience. The Fare was cheap compared to other Full Service carriers and also provided better times. 
The best was the service they provided. 

The Check in at New Delhi Metro made the journey effortless. and the security at DEL took 5 minutes only.

So There fore 5 min Checkin + 5 min waiting for metro + 20 minutes journey to Airport + 5 minutes to Security another 5 in Security...

And there it was 40 Minutes to Airside Incl Travel.

Now Walk to the gate seemed to be long, but thats not a problem.  Even with delay in deperture, arrived bagdogra before scheduled time.

The Best thing was The Food, The Service and the  Clean and well maintained Aircraft ( VT-TTJ).

The Food Provided was delecious and tasty. The Inflight Magazine was nice.

Dishonest baggage policy,Mary P,Bagdogra - New Delhi,"The flight was fine and flight crew was accommodating. However I was disappointed by what I believe to be a dishonest baggage policy. On my first inter-India flight with Vistara, I checked my reasonably sized bag no problem and with no extra fee. On this flight, however, I was told my bag (which now weighed less) was overweight. I was prepared to pay the overweight fee. I was offered an upgrade to business class for something like the equivalent of $80 USD or premium economy for $25 in order to check my baggage. 

Thinking I had no choice, I paid the $25. However, I later heard a friend of mine traveling on the same flight had mentioned she was traveling internationally and would later be on an international flight from Delhi. Vistara waived the baggage fee and said this is standard policy, as long as a customer brings it up first.

At Goa airport Vistara Kiosk wasn't working and could not identify my PNR number hence I had to go to check in counter to print boarding pass in spite of having only cabin luggage. Morning non veg snack box was served containing a chicken wrap and a muffin. Upon opening the box a live fly came out from the box. Most probably this fly was enjoying the muffin inside the box. After complaining to the crew member they quickly replaced the snack box and gave me printed apology letter which I think wasn't sufficient. Airline with tie up with Singapore airlines should be setting excellent standards in their customer service and also in providing hygienic meal to their gusts. as per Industry norms I should have been duly compensated for such a big issue but that did not happen.,Domestic,1.0,October 2018,29 October 2018,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

TOP FLIGHT,Graham P,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"I have flown on Vistara before and found it to be the best domestic airline in India. I have also flown all the other domestics so I can genuinely make the comparison. Firstly, Vistara, even as a domestic carrier flies from the International terminals so the quality there is a little higher and more relaxed. 

The flight is boarded in a relaxed manner so that people are not jammed in when trying to board. The flight attendants are first class and always have a smile. They are very efficient and caring of the passengers needs. 

But one of the best things is that the airline provides nice meals as a standard feature.

They leave on time and arrive on time....what more could you want? The only slight drawback is that the airline does not fly all routes yet, However, for the ones they do? 10 out of 10 Vistara !!!!!",Domestic,5.0,October 2018,19 October 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

I did webchekin and selected the type of food also as I was traveling with my 5 yr old daughter. The flight was neat and clean. After the takeoff food distribution started. I would like to mention that they have the policy to serve for children first. It was really a feel good factor for travellers with children. The hostess asked us for type of food and as mentioned earlier during my check in I asked for child food. But she told that child food is available only if you mentioned before 24 hrs from takeoff. I told her that I have mentioned it while selecting the seat. But she shows her inability and serve a veg meal. But after going back she might have checked and came back with child meal without much delay. I must say that the child meal beis having all dishes which a child may like. Pasta and cake were very good. 
The food was fresh and dessert was really good.
Before landing the hostess who served us gifted a Vistara cap to my daughter. She was delighted.
The flight was on time. The landing was not so smooth. But overall it was a good flight experience.",Domestic,5.0,September 2018,15 October 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Different experience due to ticketing team,Panchtattva,Kolkata (Calcutta) - New Delhi,Vistara has always been our favourite and trusted one when ever we travel. This time we chose business class. For luggage check-in we expericed a comperatively slow service. The lady who was in-charge forgot to give us boarding passes. We were travelling with an infant and after flight boarding we found our seats weren't together. That created some hassle not only to us but also our Co-passengers as flying with infants are not easy sometimes. Cabin crew team helped a lot.

Vistara Airline UK925,dinam3ba,Bengaluru - Ahmedabad,"I traveled Air Vistara recently and yes, it lived upto my expectations.

Firstly, it is a premium airline not a low cost carrier (LCC) like Indigo or Go Air. 
Now cut to check-in, they have dedicated counters for all three classes viz. Economy, premium economy & business class. When counters for premium economy & business class are free they ask the passengers of the economy class queue to other counters for smooth passage & less chaos. They greeted me with a genuine smile & spoke courteously & politely unlike others where the scene is fake smile  with standard lines being spoken with no eye contact.
During boarding, you enter the aircraft you can feel a vibrant energy with smiles & bright white light instead of fluorescent lighting & welcoming crew with new color.

FALL OF THE MIGHTY,sidhuris,New Delhi - Chandigarh,"It was a great disappointment to travel by the so called premier airline of the country, having a very good pedigree of Singapore Airlines and the House of Tatas. The travel cost for a journey of less than 250 km was more than Rs.4,000 and the delivery was minimal.  The boarding was started good 45 minutes before the take-off, with early get-ins cooling their heels in a hot environment.  The Air-hostesses were most shabbily dressed, I do not know who has designed the dresses for them, which resemble those worn by nursing staff of one horse town hospitals. Some cold sandwiches were served during the flight and I rightly opted out as the passenger on the next seat rated them as very poor. 

The landing was rather bumpy and no announcement was made of the number of belt from which the luggage could be collected.

Over-all, a very poor experience.  They are rightly thinking of going into the budget airline mode, as they rightfully belong to that category only.",Domestic,1.0,September 2018,30 September 2018,3.0,4.0,N/A,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,N/A

I walked in, the staff brought me straight to a vacant counter and before I knew it the check-in was complete and I had a lot more time the spend at the airport then expected. 

The boarding was just a smooth. They asked the passengers to board in specific groupings. So things went fast.
While boarding I was offered a bottle of water, which was nice.

The check-in attendant was super friendly and the entire process was completed in literally less than 3 minutes.

The lounge offers a good variety of snacks and full meals and the quality was excellent. 

I checked in also through separate lines and once I sat down a flight attendant asked if I wanted some water while boarding continued. The seats were clean and comfortable. I did a quick check of the rest of the airplane and it all seemed clean and in a very good condition. 

Once we were in the air I was offered another drink and presented with a menu for the lunch options. The entire experience was surreal. As a frequent traveler, this was the first time I experienced business class style service for Premium economy seats. The staff all the way to the pilots were courteous and all about making the customers comfortable. 
While in India Vistara is my airline of choice, instead of the Indigo that is like a sardine tin.

What got me was upon arrival they had a special line/ area for female passengers. I was blown away and absolutely loved it.

I think there's only one thing which was missing for Vistara to become India's best airlines is that they don't have the In-flight entertainment .

The welcome on board was pleasant and the behaviour of the crew was excellent. They were taking care of everyone. Since the plane was new so we felt the difference of comfort. I think they have enchroached upon the space of one row which could have been left for leg space. The take off was good, the flight was good and the food was also good though in a very small quantity. They, if save money from the packing, can increase the quantity of food. This is my suggestion to them. I like their beautiful packaging of the food but the cost borne on this reduces the size of food.

Go to airline in India,Jorge C,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"Vistara is a great airline in India with hub in New Delhi. I fly vistara as much as I can when in India, between cities like HYD, BLR, CCU, AHM. All flights connect in Delhi . The premium economy is great with food selection off a menu and a dedicated flight attendant. I always book premium economy as the prices are really good. on occasion I upgrade to business for about 7500INR when checking in at the counter which allows me extra weight in checked luggage of course. Most airlines in India try to squeeze every buck out of you if your luggage is overweight, sometimes even weighing your carry-on; I have found that this is not the case with Vistara as they have not charged me for a few lbs of excess weight.

Airplanes are always sparkling clean and cabin crew is extremely polite even calling passengers by name.

Good flight but breakfast needs to be improved,Ajay Kacker,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Travelled on Vistara from Delhi to Mumbai on the 8:45 am flight.

Flight was full. Managed the window seat on the emergency exit. Good leg space.

Clean take off and landing. 

My issue was with the breakfast served, especially the veg fare. Poha, which was possibly kept too long in the oven, was bland and over dry. Moreover no ketchup or chutney or lemon to go along with it. Along with the poha was the suji ka halwa;  somehow didn't quite click with my sensibilities or palate. The sweetened yoghurt and bun somehow satiated my hunger.

Why serve tea or coffee when your breakfast already covers your entire tray. Suggestion is to serve the hot beverage post serving breakfast.

An IDEAL Air Service Line,salilchjpg,New Delhi - Bagdogra,"We my wife  72 and myself  82,  have to travel by Air almost every alternate month between our homes and that of my daughter and airlines being of the shortest time taking journey and free from political obstructions we have no choice but to stick to it. And naturally our experience varies from flight to flight and Airlines to Airlines.Must confess I was rather sceptic about vistara with a preconceived notion that it is just that a high-priced service with stiff upper lip. But while searching through flights available in the net I find that it was not at all a high priced and rather convenient in time for us. So I booked our flight in Vistara. Courtesy started at the check-in counter. The young lady there offered me  one window and middle seat.we were happy. they helped us with our luggage. and helped us to our seats. These little 'Help's meant much for us. Real service started on flight. We were impressed by their personal care as to our comfort if it were alright with us etc. our country is a land of VIPs I heard we have nearly 6 hundred thousand listed an imaginable number in a civilized and a Democratic Republic. So as we are typically LIPs we never expect anything anywhere any attention and quite used to rude and curt treatment.  So those polite inquiries touched us so much! The lunch on flight is a forgotten affair. We didn't pay for it. So such good and mouthful items was something unexpected. I remember once I could not get even a little water in spite of repeated requests. The Airlines are so keen on economising their services these days! So We thanked through air hostess the captain and all the on board staff and for everything. One more point to add. I suffer from acute ear ache during landing.

Recently I traveled from Mumbai to New Delhi  by UK 930 , in Business Class. Overall service levels were great as usual, but where it faltered was in some portion of food. In my breakfast the idlis served were stale and rubbery. I showed the same to the hostess she promised to report it back to the authorities. the rest of the breakfast was good , but the overall great experience was marred by this freak experience.

Domestic Airlines - World class Feeling,Saroz G,New Delhi - Chennai (Madras),"After travelling multiple times in Vistara (both Premium Economy & Economy) writing this review

Check in was smooth and there are absolutely no issues. Ground staff are helpful and they allowed some extra luggage even after free allowance.

As there are tight schedules between the connecting flights, most of the times i got delay for boarding. The simple reason was ""incoming flight delayed""

if that’s the case, I don’t understand why they schedule the flight with that tight schedule.

Once the aircraft reaches the airport, the refilling (De boarding, Boarding, fueling, food, cleaning) was done very quick and absolutely there are no issues.

They offer the boarding Business, Premium economy and economy.

Premium Economy :

                                Dedicated air hostess
                                Welcome Drink
                                Separate Menu (for Veg and Non Veg)
                                Sufficient Legroom
                                Comfortable seats
                                Premium Cutlery
                                Priority Boarding & de boarding
Economy :
                                Sufficient Legroom
                                Comfortable seats
                          
If you plan to book the tickets well in advance, go for Premium Economy as there will be a very less difference in fare.

Because of the Traffic congestion at IGI Airport, waited almost one hour in the aircraft i hope this is because of ""incoming flight delayed"".

Vistara team worked very hard for the customer satisfaction. when the flight was delayed for almost 3 hours, they offered water bottles to the travellers.

This was great for the domestic airlines to offer something to get the customer satisfaction.

Food was excellent as this was owned by TATA and i feel food prepared specially for Vistara from TAJ.
Food Contains Bread, Butter, Salad, Dahi, Non Veg Meal, Desert, Juice, Water Bottle and of course Tea/ Coffee from Starbucks.

Crew was really good and helpful.

Fantastic Service,postcardsnpuchkas,New Delhi - Mumbai,"The check in again was quick and efficient and I was soon settled in my very comfortable seat on the flight. The leg space as promised is definitely much more as compared to Economy, the seat recline is also greater making the in-flight experience enormously more comfortable and pleasant.  I was offered a cold towel by a cheery air hostess, a much needed respite after the stickiness of the Mumbai weather. As the flight taxied I was presented a menu with 3 options to choose from  2 vegetarian and 1 non vegetarian for my lunch
 I opted for the vegetarian continental, the Oriental Vegetables with Fried Rice. Also accompanying it was a beautiful Chickpea Salad, a chilled rasmalai sort of pudding and a bread roll. A selection of cold drinks and juices is also available to go with your meal.  And if that’s not enough you can further choose to end your meal with a Starbucks Coffee or Tea.

"Poor time compliance, poor boarding staff",SnoopyDelhi,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"The flight was late by more than an hour, the handling of the delay was truly poor by the boarding staff. I wonder what makes the airline staff so rude and arrogant - perhaps it is the lack of a performance rating system so prevalent in ride-hailing services like Uber, Ola and most e-commerce retail and so completely missing in the airline industry.

The cockpit announcemeny by the pilot as well as cabin crew was unitelligible. In India, at one time, Kingfisher airlines did set the highest standards for such announcements, something that every other airline should have adopted as a good practice.

The quality of cutlery (provided in the food tray) was poor grade, the same tiny little bottle of water, the same rustic inflight experience that every economy class traveler has now come to tolerate in absence of a better standard.

Seats changed at airport,jameel h,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"Hey,

This airline only promises, but backs out in the last moment.
I had booked Delhi Bangalore ticket in July for my senior citizen parents. I had selected a meal option and seats 20 days before. They changed the seats while checking in. No prior intimation. And the way the counter staff treated us was also not good. 
I got a call today from Vistara that the seats we selected were given to some one else who paid more than us. Seriously? Is that an explanation. Why do we get an option to select seats at all? And if we take all the pain and do it. it anyway gets changed, I see no point in flying this airline which is so unprofessional.

Competent but expected better,Prathap H,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Chennai (Madras),"We took this flight with high expectations due to the reviews that Vistara had. Indeed the experience was one of a competent airline. The plane was clean, flight was on time. The boarding process was efficient. While other airlines simply announce boarding process, Vistara organized passengers into different lines based on seat number and the process was very smooth. The food was reasonable too. Indeed it is much better than budget airline experience.

However, overall we expected better. Occasionally we felt the cabin crew could have been a bit more polite with some of the passengers. I understand that passengers can also be difficult at times, still it could have been better. Our own interaction with the cabin crew was also not satisfactory on a couple of occasions, but another member of the crew did well and got us what we wanted (some hot water), so thanks for that! So perhaps the cabin crew can be urged to give more uniform high quality service, rather than with significant variation from person to person.

Overall: Good, but can be better (especially with Tata and SIA lineage!)",Domestic,4.0,August 2018,7 August 2018,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

"unprofessional, unhelpful - made us miss flight by giving wrong gate info, then charged Rs 7000 extra as penalty",Sasha G,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Had the worst experience with them. They had a last minute gate change at Delhi airport, and their check in staff gave us incorrect information on the gate, saying it’s gate 37, despite the fact that it had already changed to gate 45. At gate 37, there was no Vistara staff to let us know the gate had changed. We ended up reaching gate 45 only 2 mins after the gate closed and they refused to let us board, even though the flight wouldn’t take off for the next 15 minutes. We missed the flight in the process. 
Then Vistara representatives (specifically the manager Sudhir at Delhi Airport) were AWFUL about the situation, getting us on the next flight to Bombay at an extra cost of 3500 rupees per person, as a penalty for if passengers fail to make it to their gate. They refused to acknowledge the mistakes from their side, saying the extra cost was company policy. For their failure to inform us properly about last minute gate changes, we had to pay 7000 rupees extra (for 2 people), and they made absolutely no effort to try to reduce the cost.

India's best domestic airline,JeromeMarrel,New Delhi - Goa,"After the closure of Kingfisher Airline, India has found again luxury in the sky.
A very smooth check in where Business class counter caters only to Business class and not economy or friends.
A good luggage allowance which was welcome after 4 weeks holiday.
The service on board is excellent and very attentive.
Large seats for a 2 and a half hours flight.
A nice menu with a Starbucks coffee post lunch.
Nice welcome at the Goa airport with a porter to get our luggage on a trolley and to the car.
The only problem, which is not one really, is that they fly only to Delhi from Goa.",Domestic,5.0,June 2018,10 July 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The pilot made no warning of thr turbulence. There was a delay to warn us to put seat belts on. I have been on flights for 30 years and this was first time I noted the instability of the aircraft, while it was negotiating cloud cover. Then the pilot had the guts to stay the level of flight turbulence was normal! Passengers were in tears and people were fearful of their lives. Honestly the weather was not that bad! Having been on aircraft managing stormy weather in Central America and Middle East, as well as harsh conditions in Canada and Iceland, I am severely disappointed in thr competence of this airline.

We couldn't care less,Chandleur,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"People had told me Vistara is something to look forward to. Alas it was a let down. As a senior citizen travelling with my wife, I expected a little smile and a little accomodation regarding the seats. The lady at baggage and check in treated us with such disdain my heart missed a beat at the choice of airlines. I have definitely been treated better on Indigo and Spice jet. Vistara maybe Tata and Singapore Airlines but their heart is still not in the right place. These are frozen people; like frozen food, no taste, no freshness. Stale. She gave us the lousies seats possible at the rear of the plane.

Best airline experience,Bhargaav,Chennai (Madras) - New Delhi,"Being a frequent flyer I would say this trip was the best I've ever experienced. I have travelled with several airlines but this was the first with Vistara.
When I heard that Vistara was a colloboration between TATA and Singapore Airlines my expectations were high and the airlines fullfilled it.

1) They had wonderful leg space which was much better than other airlines even in the economy class

2) They served a wonderful breakfast. Being a vegetarian I was served Upma , Sambar Vada , Cut fruits , Bun with butter and Coffee/ Tea as . Though these are usual dishes served in other aircrafts Id say that this was the tastiest.

3) Smooth take off and landing. I never even felt like the flight was taking off or landing. I've had terrible experiences in some airlines where an ordinary landing felt like a Crash landing.

4) Kind and friendly inflight crew

5) They kept their time as said.

I would definitely wish to travel again in Vistara. Hope they increase the number of destinations especially in the south and start adding international destinations.",Domestic,5.0,July 2018,4 July 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Probably the best for domestic travel!,Payal P,New Delhi - Goa,"Vistara is great for domestic travellers as it takes off from the T-3 terminal at Delhi international airport , which is a much better airport to be in. It has friendly n polite staff and flights are mostly punctual. The staff was quite helpful. The meal served was also decent and amongst all the other airlines , this one is far more comfortable.",Domestic,4.0,June 2018,1 July 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Mosquitoes? But otherwise good,Madhulika L,New Delhi - Goa,"This flight was scheduled to depart Indira Gandhi International Airport (Terminal 3) at 11:10 AM, but got delayed by about half an hour. Shortly after everybody had boarded, the captain apologized for the delay and assured us that we would probably be able to land on time. He also warned us that because of the prevailing monsoon, turbulence could be expected. 

The good news? Not only was there little turbulence (some, but not as bad as I’d feared), we actually touched down in Goa about fifteen minutes before the ETA! Kudos to Vistara for that. 

Leg room was ample, and the cabin crew I interacted with were pleasant and efficient. Ticket fare included a meal: I opted for the non-vegetarian meal, which included steamed rice, rajma, chicken butter masala, a bread roll with butter, and a large cube of cake. The rajma was surprisingly (pleasantly!) homey, the chicken butter masala a little spicy but not bad, and the cake okay. 

My one problem with the flight was that I found myself being bitten by insects. I was dozing after the meal, and kept being nipped by something—mosquitoes?—I don’t know, from my neck down to my ankles. 

Other than that, a good flight.",Domestic,3.0,June 2018,30 June 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
Hope it remains good,ravi1603,New Delhi - Guwahati,"Good lounge at the Delhi Airport where one can relax specially if the flight gets delayed. In this case the flight was delayed due to air traffic congestion at the airport; no fault of the airlines. The service on board was excellent, Special mention for Ms. Priyadarshini and her colleagues Imli Kokla, Sarita, Mallika and Nitya for hospitality and service with a smile. Keep it up and let some of the others learn too. The pilots made a perfect landing without any jerks and bumps which are not good for a passenger like me. I hope Vistatra will progress and remain good and not resort to cutting corners which some of the other airlines are doing.

"Rude staff, no knowledge of their own policies and manager has no clue. Complaining to regulatory body",reena s,Amritsar - New Delhi,"Disgusting service. Rude and pathetic staff at the airport. Think they have power over customers.

I booked my flight in February 2018 before they changed their excess baggage policy in March 2018. I was reassured by their telephone representative that thee airline has a duty to honour the same baggage allowance as my onward flight from Delhi to London provided it is within 24 hours of my Air Vistara Flight from Amritsar to Delhi. I had a telephone recording of the conversation as proof.

I arrived at Amritsar Airport and they made me pay for my excess baggage despite me having proof that they shouldn't and that I booked my ticket prior to their baggage policy being changed. It cost me nearly 14,000 Indian Rupees to pay on the spot, otherwise I would have missed my onward international flight from Delhi to London.

The incompetent Air Vistara staff at Amritsar Airport had me and my mother who was travelling with me call my travel agent in London on an out of hours telephone number as they did not understand my international flight details when presented to them (that is not my fault). Their manager was just as incompetent as his colleagues I dealt with. 

I have not received an apology for the treatment I received from Air Vistate staff. They have paid my back the money charged me for excess baggage however I was charged by my UK Bank to use my card for the payment at the airport, and myself and my mother were charged by our British mobile phone providers for the phone calls to the travel agent at the request of Air Vistatra staff, as a result of their inadeqyate training.

I have today reached out to Air Sewa to recover the nearly 8,000 Indian Rupees still owed to me by the airline, who treat international customers as a joke.

Good luck competing on the international stage with your incompetent staff!

Never again would I use this airline...I have used Jet and Air India to travel from Amritsar to Delhi many times and I will be sticking to those airlines in future.",Domestic,2.0,April 2018,28 June 2018,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

As my flight started from Mumbai, I was comfortably watching a video on my Ipad when suddenly the air-hostess came & asked me to switch off my I-phone, I-pad & MP3 music player as using it in flight is not allowed. When i told them that I-pad is wifi only & there is no network communication & I-phone + I-pad both are already on flight mode, they didnt agree & asked me to switch those off else action would be taken against me.
Harrowing act was to even not allow Music player to be used (music player had nothing to interfere & my music player doesnt even have wifi or bluetooth or radio to inferefere).

Overall the flight experience including Food, Service was good except that the flight was late in departure & arrival both.
There is nothing for In-Cabin entertainment.

Thai Flight attendant with huge attitude,NiteLifeMedia,Mumbai - New Delhi,"I'm a regular with Vistara and prefer flying with them over other airlines due to their fabulous service and connectivity. However this time flying back from Mumbai i had the worst experience flying vistara. 

There was a Thai Flight attendant who was extremely rude and curt in her responses to not only me but other passengers as well. I had to request to talk to the Flight Purser to get the situation resolved .

Another passenger was being loud and watching movies on his iPad without headphones and was not even wearing his seatbelt. Being disturbed by the loud noise i requested the flight attendant to move to another seat that was empty and was denied it saying someone else was coming to it. We were airborne and i asked how could someone board the plane if we are airborne. She just smiled and walked away. I again requested that she either address the noisy passenger or allow me to move to another seat. She told me that if i wanted to move to premium economy i could but i'd have to pay for the seat. The manner in which she said it was taunting and then said so you wanna pay or not.  I requested to talk to the purser and got my seat changed to avoid any disturbance. 

So since when does vistara not care for other passengers and show attitude like that thai flight attendant. Also how can Vistara even take off and violate FAA rules when a passenger is refusing to put on a seatbelt and playing movies without headphones. Shouldn't that passenger be deboarded ?",Domestic,4.0,June 2018,21 June 2018,5.0,5.0,N/A,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Backed by Tata and groomed by Singapore Airlines to excellence,Sourav Datta,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"This was the best flight of my life till date. Separate check in counters and boarding lanes for Business, Premium Economy and Economy. Ground services were just awesome. Cabin crew members were well behaved, professional, helpful and courteous. All three cabins are separated by curtains and all cabins have different colors of lights which acts as mood changers. I suggest, travel Premium Economy which offers unmatched benefits and also the cost is little more than Economy. Foods were served for free accompanied by one soft drink and Starbucks coffee. Choice of meals were also there. At Kolkata, luggage was delivered on priority since I travelled Premium Economy. Only disadvantage is that, they do not offer On board entertainment but that too will be shortly implemented, after all they are the youngest in Indian aviation.

Vistara Business Class – Ground Experience:

#1. Dedicated CheckIn 

I arrived at the Chennai airport 3 hours prior to departure , which I generally do. I spend time trying Lounges facilities and roam around the airport. The checkin started for the Vistara flight MAA-CUU. I approached to the counter , there was separate counter for the Vistara Club Members . So the checkin process was done quickly and I got the boarding pass within minutes. 

#2 . Security – No Fast track lane:

After getting the boarding pass I quickly approached towards security hold , done with my security checks and then had some soft drinks from self service counter( where you put the money in machine mention which drinks you want, it automatically comes) .

I have now used Vistara several times and each time they have been excellent.  On time, clean and modern fleet, good service from check in to crew and options of business, premium economy and economy ticket prices.  

I have used both business and premium economy and recommend the premium economy for combination of quality and value.

The legroom and seat pitch were great.
No screens for entertainment are available on vistara aircrafts and i personally don't have an issue with it.
The food served was amazing in taste as well as presentation.
The only two things I found odd were that at the airport gate no special seating area is available for business class or Vistara Club members. The limited seating is full very fast and we have to stand there for atleast 20mins which is not so good if you are paying for business or premium economy.
The second thing odd was that no dessert was served on board even when it was on the menu. Other than that i feel vistara business class is the way to fly.",Domestic,4.0,June 2018,11 June 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Commendable Service,_gsmanoharan,New Delhi - Bhubaneswar,"I had a last minute change in my itinerary and hence had to visit my sister in Bhubaneswar. Booked the tickets from Vistara website wherein the navigation was easy.
Arrived in T3 terminal through Air Arabia from Sharjah and breezed in to the Domestic Terminal.
The check was Super Fast and my luggage tagged to priority. The boarding pass invited us to the lounge near Gate No 41. At the Vistara Lounge the reception was Top Class with Professional / Service oriented staff ( The spoon and fork were delivered to my table with a bow). The spread was heart warming .. Hot Conjeevaram Idlis served with 3 types of chutney, Sambar and Idli podi. The buffet also featured tasty Upma, parantha with aloo, scrambled eggs, fruit platter, corn flakes and a host of pastries ( brownie was mouth watering). Ambience was quite good with all type of seating to choose from.
Departure was announced and the boarding was efficient. Yashika, Anshika and the Hostess team received every one with a warm greeting, regardless of the class of travel.
Yashika was quick to notice the weary traveller in me and hence did not waste any time to support me with a cup of water and cold towel. 
Due to the overnight travel was not interested in the breakfast offering and was inclined to doze off.. But a cursory look at the menu card tempted me to request a breakfast.. and I did make a good decision. Fruit platter included Kiwi, the paneer was nicely diced and served (not the standard cubes) along with the paranthas. Curd went off smoothly and was offered bread and croissants. Surprise addition was Starbucks coffee made from Coorg Arabica beans ( but the temperature was lukewarm).
Then I started to browse the newspapers ( as I had to update myself for my next 10 day stay in India).
Yashika offered my periodicals also and hence my day was made!!!
Himanshu piloted the A320 Neo among the clouds during descent ably and we had a safe landing on time. 
Had a rewarding experience during my Maiden Flight in Vistara.. Young and Dynamic team will take Vistara to New Heights!!!!

The complimentary food is a highlight to keep you occupied during flights,Shweta Sarkar G,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I usually travel with my 4 year old son who's highlight in the flight is the food that comes. The fod being served on all flights is so freaking expensive that when it comes (being added in your bill doesnot directly impact you) seems like it is coming free of cost, it really adds a silver lining.  But twice in a row i was disappointed to be served vegetarian food inspite of having mentioned non veg at the time of booking my tickets. So that was kind of stressful for a hard core non vegetarian like me. The first time they claimed that they had run out of non veg and on the same return journey, they claimed that there was an error and against my name they couldnot find non veg. My bad luck but might help future passengers in future to take a printed proof at the time of booking.

"Comfortable cabin, warm service!",Suhail Vadgaokar,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"Vistara is a breath of fresh air compared to the rubbish that flies in the India skies. The cabin (Economy) is very comfortable. Decent pitch, seat cushions are suitable for a 3 hours flight, no inflight entertainment though :(
The service is warm and professional. Food served is also quite good.

"UK 714, UK 955 for Srinagar to Mumbai via Delhi",venkateshkini,Srinagar - Mumbai,"UK 714, UK 955 for Srinagar to Mumbai via Delhi was wonderful. The earlier flight from Jammu to Srinagar was delayed by 20-25min, so subsequently delayed departure by 20mins from Srinagar at 3:40pm instead of 3:20pm for flight UK 714, yet fantastic arrangement by  Vistara at the arrival in Delhi at 5:15pm who ensured 15 passengers alighted from UK 714 and boarded UK 955 in 15mins at 5:30pm including a security check. Woth on time departure at 5:45pm and the early arrival in Mumbai at 7:45pm instead of 8:05pm was amazing. The food could improve though. And the aircraft were Airbus 320 and 320 neo, in excellent condition. Our 6 year old son was surprised when he received a Vistara branded cap too.

Excellent Service at the time of delay,manjulanair207,New Delhi - Mumbai,My return flight to Delhi was delayed by 50 minutes & the airlines informed me couple of hours before through sms. So that i could plan my travel better. They also provided a valid reason for the delay. Infact the most surprising fact was that they had arranged for light refreshments at a cafe counter for the impacted passengers. The pilot posted the passengers about the entire delay & clearly stated how much time it will take for us to fly out of Mumbai. Delays are very unpleasant but when you are informed about it all through the journey & the team empathise with you & take extra care of you then the impact is lesser.

An New Experience,Arun Kumar g,New Delhi - Guwahati,This was my third flight by Vistara. Ihave started liking this Airlines for simply provided comfirt & very good tasty food.

"They keep raising the bar, flight after flight.",Arup G,Kolkata (Calcutta) - New Delhi,"A disclaimer right at the beginning. I am a Platinum Member of their frequent flyer programme and have been so for two years now. Therefore my bias for this airline is obvious. When I share my very positive experiences with Vistara with friends and family, they invariably suggest that I write about my trips. So finally here I am. Inspite of my obvious bias, I will try to be objective as I pen these few lines. 

Vistara is the only Indian domestic airline which offers Premium Economy. Same 3+3 layout as Economy on their A320s but with a bit more generous legroom. Their Economy seats have a pitch of 31"" with a recline of 3.5"" although I suspect the extreme rear rows may have a slightly less pitch. The Premium Economy seats have a pitch of 33"" with a recline of 4.5"". Those extra couple of inches does make a huge difference.

Reached Kolkata airport at about 6 am for my 7.05 am flight to Delhi. Had checked in online the previous night. Being a Platinum Member they offer complimentary lounge access and the online boarding pass mentioned the lounge invitation. However, as happens often times, there never is time to pop into the lounge. Went straight through security and to the boarding gate. Picking up a cup of tea on the way. 

Vistara boarding is always an organised affair. I really can't put a finger on what they do different but there never is the kind of melee that you see around boarding gates of most other airlines. They started boarding at 6.24 am. We were bussed to a distant stand. Quite a few minutes of bus ride. To a very far stand beyond the old terminal building.

Now, if I have one complain with Vistara and indeed with most other airlines, is that the first flight out of the day is always from a non-aerobridge stand. The planes that come in late on the previous night are parked at stands away from the terminal. Every airline that does that, seems to avoid the expenditure of getting the aircraft to an aerobridge gate for the first flight out the next morning. Instead they subject you to an uncomfortable crowded bus ride. Vistara also does the same. 

Boarding was quick and orderly. The welcoming cold towel (hot in winters) is always a nice touch. Then they handed over the breakfast menu. Another nice touch. A round of water. Boarding complete and doors close at 6.50 am, well before scheduled 7.05 am departure. 

Then the Government owned Kolkata Airport's inefficiency took over. It wasn't till 7.06 am that we were pushed back. And another 10 mins odd before we were airborne. 20/25 mins on the ground after doors closed? Nah, that sort of thing seems to happen only at Indian airports. I don't know who is to be blamed.

I always enjoy the nice clean interiors, the new planes, very comfortable seats, the rather different purple and gold colour scheme. Even the cabin crew wears a purple and gold uniform. I always see the lady cabin crews wearing a similar metallic gold watch and pearl ear studs which go very well with the purple uniform. Haven't seen any other airline standardising the accessories that go with the uniform. That's a real neat touch.

Breakfast time a little later. Meals are always a pleasurable affair on Vistara. I am a hardcore non vegetarian but could not resist the Sabudana Khicdi and Medu Vada in Sambhar that morning. Awesome. Some of the meals I have had on Vistara were memorable. But more of that later. The Starbucks coffee they serve in Business and Premium Economy is another first. Imagine pricey Starbucks coffee on an aircraft! 

We were over Delhi well in time but were then a victim to the usual early morning congestion that's routine at Delhi. Inspite of that we were on the ground a couple of minutes earlier than the scheduled 9.25 am arrival. Aerobridge connected quickly and I was off the aircraft at 9.34 am. Very happy.

Vistara seems to be setting a new bench mark in Indian domestic aviation. I sure do hope they maintain that standard.",Domestic,5.0,May 2018,2 June 2018,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Absolutely my favourite domestic Indian airline!,wjw2018,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"I've flown with Vistara many times because their prices are always competitive, they have good flight timings, the aircraft are new and they provide meals onboard which are included in the ticket price. This flight from Hyderabad to Delhi was no exception. Comfortable seats with great legroom and good ambient lighting throughout. The cabin attendants were immaculate as usual and served a lovely meal of chicken in a tomato sauce with pitta breads shortly after take off. To be honest I can't fault this airline in any way because they do everything perfectly, especially considering they're a low cost airline. Highly recommended for any flight throughut India as the experience is always sublime. Oh, and if they offer you an upgrade to the premium seats at a nominal fee at check-in, it's worth trying at least once in your life because you get even MORE upgraded service and food than the economy seats!",Domestic,5.0,N/A,1 June 2018,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

In most other similar airlines I had traveled before one had to buy one's meals at inflated prices.

The seats were spaced reasonably good and I did not feel cramped as I felt in other airlines.  However mind you many - not all economy seats - do not have lean back seats. On a three hour flight a lean back seat affords slightly improved comfort . On this flight my wife and I had seat No. 09A and 09B and both were non reclining seats.

The website, mobile app and the customer care are all excellent and customer friendly. The check in was smooth, got an upgrade to business using my complimentary voucher thanks to CV. Upgraded my son's ticket too by paying. 
Food, beverages and cleanliness was excellent too. Thanks to Kusang, Lhouvino, Chaitali, Sahiba and Burhan. 
Unfortunately the last leg of journey was troubling as in my opinion the pilot erred in landing. A major disaster was averted at the last seconds, the wheels were maybe seconds from touching tarmac when it was airborne again abruptly, taken to great height and landed back after 15 minutes. Pilot blamed the winds but it was a case of higher speed and altitude during touchdown. A major mistake in my opinion. 
All's well that ends well....Thank you Almighty",Domestic,5.0,N/A,9 May 2018,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Followed by very professional and forever smiling  crew Nitika, Joycy, Akshika and Yuwakshi were such extremely beautiful set of team which made me felt wow.. the way they delivered service with such warmth and respect it reminded me of Jet airways in the year 2002-2004 which use to be the best airlines of India.

Vistara Airlines - A Full service alternative airline in India,198pradeep,Mumbai - New Delhi,"On 6/5/18, I took a Mumbai -Delhi flight on Vistara Airlines ( uk 902). Being a platinum member of Jet Airways frequent flyer programme for almost a decade and having used Jet Airways almost as a default choice for a quarter century ( ever since its inception), I was keen to fly on Vistara for comparative study.
Web check in through mobile app failed but was  successful  via their website opened on desktop. Lady at check in counter was efficient and helpful, the process was slightly better than usual experience with Jet.The Vistara aircraft appeared slightly more tidier and specious. It was probably due to less than 100% occupancy. Seats appeared a bit more comfortable.
Food quantity and quality was similar. Quality of in flight announcements was similar and uniform and smartness was similar and mediocre.

Their focus on passenger comfort and customer service is commendable. The flight  departure and arrival was on time and included smooth take off and landing. Our flight to Delhi was via Srinagar and the weather was pretty cloudy. However, the plane was capable enough to handle the turbulence level. I'm a frequent flyer and I can very well recognise this technical difference. The plane was clean and smelled good with mild fresheners they must have used. There was ample leg space and that really matters for tall people like me and my brother. The food was amazing in taste and quality. The staff was polite and on their toes to help people.

Even if I want to use miles or vouchers, i am being told that the business is full and when you sot in the aircraft you see seats available in business. They want to just sell. I am not sure why you make platinum members. They give preference to staff than passengers. I had complaint in writing n number of times, i do not get acknowledgement forget about solution. Complimentary upgrades are also been used with miles upgrade. Their ground staff knows nothing.

There were few male passengers who were again and again seeking some services and she was politely handling it  with the smile on her face. She is an asset to Vistara and i wish her all the best for her future. This is the reason i have moved from Jet Airways to Vistara. the services which Vistara gives is much better then you can except.

Not only this even to keep W/L was not agreed.moreover it was really further shocking to learn  that original seat which was non reclined wanted to change it  was told that flight is under control of  air port which is quite unusual before 48 hours which never happens in any airlines.

Mismanaged traveller information on meals. Rude hostess.,AmarKoslia,Srinagar - New Delhi,"Everything went perfect till boarding gate. The staff was helpful and adjusted our requirements as we were a large group of 7 people including women and children.

The guy on the boarding gate was rude and irritated when asked that would it be possible to board the plane on priority as we had cranky children with women in our group. Secondly after mentioning child meal plan and getting written and oral confirmation from your airline still there was no child meal. 

The hostess didn't even offer us water for 20 mins including the time where service was conducted. Coffee is worthless as creamer based black coffee  made into brown coffee is the worst I've had in years.

The person from north east of Indian origin presumably the senior hostess had rudeness written all over her face and actions. Some alter ego she had. Didn't get her name or would have surely mentioned it here.

All in all a below average experience compared to indigo and spicejet. 

The only plus was the aeroplane type, design and seating. Also for the same price as an indigo in the same sector it was worth it. The pilots ability to handle the plane was good but sorry to say no ability to have a dialogue with his / her passengers.

I didn't like it.

I being thirsty wanted water, which was not given instantly. Not a big issue as during take on and take off it may be possible. However when cabin girl came with food cart I just picked up a bottle of water from cart top, which is usual and followed by a smile of cabin girl. To my utter surprise the cabin girl virtually snatched water bottle from my hand and said you can not take like this and then gave me after some time when cart came to my seat.

Never Fly Vistara Airlines if You Can Help It!,Larry K,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"From beginning to end- this airline was a complete nightmare. 

1. Rude, inefficient, could-care-less counter agents
2. Because I was slightly over the 24 hr periods since my international flight, my 30 kg bag cost an addition $185 because of the 15 kg domestic weight limit (try flying with 2 weeks of suits for business for 15 kgs)
3. Having to go to a separate cashier to pay for the excess baggage took an additional 45 minutes to the long check-in; barely making it to the flight;
4. Rude clumsy security guards opened my carry-on spilling two gifts to the floor shattering them- not even an apology;
5. Cattlecall boarding with rude people butting in line and gate agents not caring at all

And to top it off- 
6. They LOST my bag on a direct flight with all suits and shirts and toiletries for my work the next day. Baggage claim was horrific and bureaucratic and I still don’t have my checked suitcase (for which I paid extra). No offer to bring my bag to my hotel the next day when it was scheduled to arrive “you’ll have to pick it up at the ticket counter.”
7.  After involving US Embassy to get Vistara to bring my bag from Dehli to Bungaluru; the bag arrived at the hotel - it looked as if it had been turned completely upside down and emptied out.  Missing were my extra iPhone case, power cables, my waterproof iPhone case.  My extra kit for medicines had been gone through and antibiotics taken.  The zipper of the suitcase had been pried open and the zipper broken so you couldn't seal the suitcase completely, and one of the four wheels had been destroyed (I had to throw it away).  Our belief is that this probably occurred because the suitcase sat overnight in the Delhi airport and Vistara had not locked it away for safe keeping.

NEVER ever again. We took Indigo and Jet Airways for other flights internal to India and had none of these issues.  You have several alternative airlines to use for these routes in India. I would recommend using them.",Domestic,1.0,April 2018,8 April 2018,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Rude behavior of Vistara's Ground staff,jeyeshna,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,"We travelled from Kochi (Cochin) to Delhi on Vistara Flight UK 882 on 25.03.2018 . We had a consumed Chivas Regal liquor bottle in our check in baggage, which had around 150 ml of alcohol. At CIAL (Kochi) airport, as per the direction of a Vistara ground staff, when we scanned our check in baggage in the Vistara X-ray counter, he did not allow us to carry the liquor bottle. We told him that it is not in our hand baggage and we have tightly sealed and secured the bottle, so that it won’t spill. We also had perfume in a glass bottle. He did not create any problem regarding that. He only had a problem with the Chivas regal bottle. He asked to put it in the dust bin. We suspect that because it was an expensive liquor, he wanted to take it from us. If he wanted that, he could have asked me for a new bottle and I would be happy to buy him a new one. I told him that I have carried open liquor bottles several times in both domestic as well as international flights and there was no problem at all. Another CIAL staff told him that it is permitted to carry the bottle. But he was so adamant and arrogant and did not allow us to take it. Later when we checked with CISF staff as well as other Vistara staff in Kochi and Delhi, they told that we can carry consumed liquor bottle in our check in baggage in a manner that it won’t spill in our baggage. The Vistara staff at the Kochi airport X-ray counter unnecessarily created a problem for us. We lost so much time because of this and created unnecessary tension in our pleasure trip.

Good Choice for Traveling in India,Redoranges,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"First time trying out this 4 years old airline which also happens to be a joint venture between Tata and Singapore Airlines. Besides this leg, was also on Mumbai to Delhi leg 2 days prior. 

Compared to Jet Airways, aircraft seems comparable though the last time I took Jet Airways in 2016 on domestic, the aircraft seems newer for Jet.

Service wise, obviously the staff are trained by SIA/Silk Air team and it feels like you are on Silk Air. 

Food wise, portion bigger than Jet Airways if I remember correctly. Taste wise is quite normal for economy. 

Being a Krisflyer member (just normal level), my baggage was tagged priority as Premium Economy passenger. The ground staff at Mumbai even stamped priority on my boarding pass and told me I could board with the Premium Economy group. Although this did not help much as most already boarded when I was at the gate. 

Interestingly, from Delhi to Bangalore, I did not get above. However, during boarding I saw the economy queue was quite long and I walked over to the priority lane and ask nicely if I could board first as a Krisflyer member and the agent say to go ahead.

Sandeep,LoveTravel744279,Goa - New Delhi,Very very disappointed with the way staff behaved!! I travelled with my 76 year old mother in business class from Goa to Delhi on Uk 884 on 13th March 2018. We were seated on 1A and 1C. The cabin crew was not at all considerate to an old lady. She was the last one to be asked and served meal. When everyone had finished we were served. I completely fail to understand the reason for this behaviour. It has left such a bad impact on us and I don’t have words how I felt despite spending so much she did  not even a basic courtesy to a senior citizen. The crew in general was very very slow and were just busy chatting. I have never experinced anything like this before where the crew was so lazy and completely not bothered. I pressed attendants button atlest thrice and no one turned up. It’s unbelievable how careless the crew can be. I sincerely hope a reputed airline like your will take some serious action and in future no senior citizen will go through the humiliation which my mother did today.,Domestic,1.0,March 2018,13 March 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Truly it's a new feeling,Rahul M,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"When flying on domestic routes my first preference used to be Jet Airways but when I tried Vistara for the first time on a Delhi-Pune route everything changed and I have been choosing Vistara as my preferred airlines on domestic routes.

Vistara is a Tata-Singapore Airlines joint venture and one can expect both class and competitive pricing. Vistara has an all Airbus 320 fleet and are introducing the 320 Neo and Bengaluru to Delhi is one such route where Vistara flies their new 320 neo aircrafts.

Check-in and Boarding Experience:

The best part is that I had Vistara Silver club membership which came with a complimentary class upgrade so at the check-in counter I got an upgrade from economy to premium economy. Now premium economy has it's advantages like priority luggage tags applied, priority boarding etc. 

Vistara flight was on time and got quick access to the plane through priority lane and was greeted by cabin crew. 

On Board Experience:

As expected premium economy seats had extra leg rooms, came with a soft pillow as well. The new 320 neo had mood lightning so it truly was refreshing.

Vistara has a menu for premium economy and offers some really good dinner on board. They also serve Starbucks coffee in this class which was good. Food quality and quantity were both appreciable. Good job in that department.

Overall a nice experience on board and we reached before time.

Deboarding Experience:

The best part is that in Delhi Vistara operates from T3 terminal and on this terminal arrival experience is like a cake walk. Due to priority tags the luggage arrived too early that it was taking a second round on the conveyor belt. 

Final Thoughts:

Flying Vistara was truly a new feeling and I am waiting for Vistara to start its international operations soon. Also, I have seen that it seems to be the only airlines which provides special assistance to female travellers in terms of allocating good seats and helping with the baggage pick-up to arranging a taxi.",Domestic,4.0,N/A,2 March 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

A full value for money airline which at a little more than low cost carriers provide a luxurious experience.

Further to air traffic in Mumbai the flight got diverted to Ahmadabad ad I finally reached Mumbai at 12.30 in the night, a good 4 hours delayed.

Vistara- My most enjoyable flight experience..New feel indeed!!,UdayTewary,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Delhi airport ground staff were very helpful and courteous. The crew was very efficient, helpful and warm. The cabin crew ensured placing of luggage with those having difficulty especially in the latter part of the plane. Every one was seated well in time and the pilot's greetings was comforting. The flight was full, all passengers seated hence the flight started for the runway a bit in advance. Towards the takeoff bend it was held up by the air traffic controller giving priority to Air India flights. Due to this we landed a bit late, however the exact time of landing was informed about 30 min in advance and the Captain was very accurate.

Very good service.,Sunnybono70,New Delhi - Chandigarh,"The reason why I like Vistara airlines is their luggage allowance for domestic flights.  If you are traveling in business class and have an international flight, vistara Airlines allows you to exceed your baggage allowance as long as you show them an international flight the same day or the next day. This is one of the main reasons why I choose to take the starter Airlines another reason is the fact that they fly an Airbus A320 which is a lot more comfortable than one of those ATR aircraft",Domestic,5.0,N/A,5 February 2018,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Bizarre rules,Prowander,Goa - New Delhi,"It's challenging to fly and even more challenging when airlines or flight attendants make up new rules.  After dealing with a chaotic check-in process in GOA, we got on a completely full flight.  Service was similarly chaotic with carts repeatedly going up and down the isle multiple times for no apparent reason.  Special meals were handed out in random order - some before the main meal was served - some after the main meal was served.  Sleeping passengers were woken up to ask about their meal options - which seemed crazy.  If people are sleeping - let them sleep.  When all calmed down - I peacefully continued reading my book on the iPad.  All was well until landing when Philo. the flight attendant, decided I needed to completely power off my iPad.

OK experience,themudgeerambler,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,we upgraded to premium economy at check in and were glad of the extra legroom on the flight. Also it was good to be able to board the plane first instead of waiting till everyone had boarded to avoid the crush. Not sure that we got any different food but it was also good to get the priority luggage so once again you arent elbow to elbow trying to get your luggage off the conveyor. Flight was delayed but once in the air it was smooth with a great touchdown.,Domestic,3.0,December 2017,10 January 2018,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0
Rude Ground staff,Surpreet K,Amritsar - New Delhi,"I have travelled on Vistara on couple of occasions and have traveled in all its classes of operations. Their service level onboard is outstanding for all classes. After good old Air Sahara, I think there's is the only airline currently in India ,with pleasant cabin crew members. Their checkin staff at counters is also good and provides you all help needed. I have never ever had any problem with the airline's staff other than this one incident that happened on my way back to Delhi from Amritsar.
Checkin was smooth and it was only while boarding that all chaos happened. So basically when boarding was announced, there were 2 lines made by the crowd and it was difficult to see the priority boarding board as there were a lot of people ahead of us in groups. We were total 8 of us,including 2 kids and 4 senior citizens. So our parents  were ahead of us and were sent thru the same line in which we had lots of other passengers also. I was stopped rudely by the ground staff Puneet Sharma(who told his name also so rudely when asked), and was told that I was in wrong line as this was priority boarding line. He shouted at the top of his voice for this and honestly I don't think that was needed. I was traveling with a 2 year old in my lap and a 10 year old, so even if the airline does not gives priority to families with kids(I was told this by the same guy and confirmed by the duty manager that vistara has policy not to give priority to families with young kids), still all this guy could have done, was to be polite. People are returning after a small holiday and he is just at the right place to ruin it. Extremely rude and arrogant guy. Duty manager should realize that sending the flight off at right time is not the only responsibility but he also has to make sure that same people travel again with their airline by training his staff well. If people don't buy tickets,unfortunately you guys also will stop getting paid. Taking sides for rudeness is absolutely not acceptable. Thumbs down for these 2 people from otherwise marvelous staff of Air Vistara.",Domestic,2.0,January 2018,10 January 2018,5.0,5.0,N/A,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Beware the web site,Robert W,New Delhi - Varanasi,"When I tried to book directly, it looks like the web site isn't working after you've put in your card details because it seems to wipe the numbers. Assuming my purchase had failed I moved to ClearTrip and within seconds had my tickets. To my horror, I also had tickets in my email inbox for the same flights from Vistara. Ever since, I have been trying to get my money back from Vistara because I would have been charged a big penalty by ClearTrip. After almost two weeks of me sending emails, making calls and enlisting the support of their office at Varanasi, I have not had any written communication from them that confirms my refund (actually, the only email I received was within an hour of my first email asking for a copy of the ClearTrip ticket which I did, immediately). Their customer service is non-existent. Beware.

Dealt with poorly through-out,Alex M,Port Blair - Kolkata (Calcutta),"At the end of our time at the Andaman Islands, all we wanted from our economy seats was to take off with the view of beautiful islands below. Honestly, domestic flights give a unique view of India (try Varanasi to Jaipur, for a view of the Ganges)

Arriving very early for the flight as one of the first to check-in we were told that we could get Business for the price off premium economy. Shown the picture of the fancy seats and all we thought, 'Why not lets treat ourselves' Thats £20 not £100's, no brainer

We were told to wait next the counter until they allocated our seats. However, after the airport police, immigration and even members of Vistara had hassled us about our nearly missing the flight, myself going to teh desk three times and being told to wait 2 more minutes, we got our boarding pass.

We were then pushed through the airport like we had arrived super late. Marched on to the plane past the business class seats into premium economy... which is rubbish. Its economy seating with a food option.

Furthermore we had aisle seats two seats away from any view.

Having been hassled I quickly made a point of telling someone there had been a mistake. I was told to sit down and the head of the ground crew came to talk to me. I expressed my concern that we had been pushed around and given the wrong seats. He told me he would be back and left the plane. Before you know it we were rolling on to the runway.

I was so annoyed to have payed more to get less and be treated poorly that I talked to the head of crew cabin.... who were helpful and professional.

I was told that it had been logged and that I could enjoy the free food. My details taken and that i could have a refund of sorts.

After teh flight I emailed Vistara and they took a month to get back, told me that it was very bad what had happened but nothing of a refund. At this point I should say that the refund is only small but it was the principle of the thing. I was still annoyed at the treatment by the staff on the ground. Being lied to about the upgrade, made to wait, pushed around and then not listed to and left on the plane.

I kept on asking about teh refund and did not get a clear answer. They used peripheral wording to drag my attention from the matter.

This is the most expensive option you can have. I would use spice jet ever bit of the way. For a domestic flight they are cheap, efficient and run to and from nearly everywhere. You can upgrade for a fiver for extra leg room with window seats and they give you some snacks as well.

Vistara, would rather hold on to a little money in anyway they can instead of except their own blame. I was told that we had used teh service, but I had been told to except it by way of a sorry on the plane.",Domestic,3.0,December 2017,9 January 2018,2.0,2.0,N/A,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

One of the best in the Indian domestic market,RaktimRay,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"This domestic airline formed as a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and TATA is the best in its class. It brings all the right elements from SIA, one of the leading airlines companies in the world and the indian business expertise from one of the biggest companies in India. Everything starting from the booking process to seat selection, which is free by the way, and goes a long way in providing customer satisfaction, to on time departures and efficient boarding process and most importantly, lavish seating and leg space. They are also probably the only airlines in the domestic indian circuit which serves meals on board free of charge and they have a wide variety to choose from like vegan, religious and the likes. The baggage collection doesn’t make you wait either and here is a little secret, even if your bags are a little over the capacity, they are very accommodating if you are in their frequent flyer program and that too even without asking. In short, this was by far the best domestic travel experience I had in India. Flights may be a bit on the expensive side and the airline is pretty new and as result is absent from most of the sectors in the domestic route but I hope they expand their reaches soon. In short I will close my eyes and fly with them again and I don’t mind shelling the extra buck for their service.",Domestic,4.0,October 2017,9 January 2018,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

They have trained their staff to ensure passengers experiences a world class service. I had this opportunity to experience the warmth of Vistara courtesy during my last flight from Chandigarh to Delhi where in Vistara's Airport manager Mr.Gautam Mehta and his colleague Priya (Check in /  boarding Incharge) left no stone un-turned to assist me and my other overseas guest who were travelling along with me.

The overseas guest were so impressed with not only the hospitality of the ground staff but were amazed the moment they stepped inside the cabin to experience the Vistara's 5 star service. 

What was noteworthy was one of the overseas guest shared that this was one of the best domestic flight that he has taken in recent times.

On Sept 17 I believe all information regarding the card as requested by your team was sent. I got all alerts regarding flight changes on my phone. I also got sms regarding checkin online, however that didnt work, and when i called the customer service they said it was coz of the international card. Inspite of all this when we reached the airport, we had to wait for 20 minutes to get the boarding pass. When we got in the plane we were assigned the last available seats which we could not recline back hence an uncomfortable for me.  

On our return journey, once again we could not do the online check in, once again we waited another 20 minutes for the same international card to be verified, again we got the last seats available, which could not be reclined. To top it all, there was a bag which was held due to a battery in it, we were strolling in the airport for 2 hours during which they could have called us to inform about the stranded bag, and finally when we were about to board they tell us about the bag and that the bag cannot be sent in the same flight. we had to travel back to the airport the next day spending 7 hrs on the road two way to get the bag.

This also makes it usually an expensive and crowded flight in the morning. Most of the passengers were business travellers and had done web check-in leading to a long queue for baggage drop-in. The good part is that the staff was responsive and diverted few of us to the premier check-in (very thoughtful and appreciated) to save time. 

boarding experience at the gates is average. 

The inflight experience is good mainly due to the legroom which makes the journey quite comfortable and you can discount other inconveniences due to this good factor.

Great Experience and Hospitality,Rachit G,Lucknow - New Delhi,"Vistara is a premium economy airlines in India owned by the TATA Group. One of the first things you'd notice about the airlines is the refreshing energy of their ground staff, right from the check-in counter, all the way to de-boarding the plane after your journey.
India is quickly reaching that saturation stage where due to the high number of frequent flyers, the airlines industry is become less and less customer-centric like in other developed nations like the US & UK. Amidst all this, flying with an airline that still considers its customers as guests and treats them with complimentary warm food and beverages is a welcome step. Added to that, the pleasant legroom space in their new Boeing A320s fleet and multicolored ambience inside the plane is bound to relieve you during the tiring journey.

Excellent Flight,833Pat,New Delhi - Goa,"We were booked on a consolidated ticket through BA from Home to Goa. The connecting airline in Delhi was Vistara. As we had booked Premium Economy with BA we were graded the same with Vistara. We had priority check in as well as boarding. When the flight was first announced there was a call for business customers. I usually find that people do not listen to this announcement and get up ready to board and there is a lot of jostling. Not this time. It was well managed by the airline team. When they called for Premium Economy we went forward and to our delight we found we had been upgraded to Business. Very comfortable seating, menu provided for lunch and a nice meal was served. 
I recognise this is a fairly new airline but I have to say both my husband and I were impressed by the cleanliness of the aircraft, the hospitality of the staff and unlike our usual internal flights in India everything was very calm and relaxed.

5-Star service,Kanwal N,Amritsar - Mumbai,"OMG peeps... I never imagined an Airline that's so comforting, I felt at home. Vistara, I hereby, give you a standing ovation for such a fabulous service. Right from Baggage Screening to Disembarking and Carousel, you guys were absolutely fabulous. I don't think I frowned even one bit.  The crew were smiling at all times. Make-up was right on point. And their galleys, spotless. Even their ovens were spick and span. 
You guys must be wondering how I know so many technicalities in detail. Well, I'm from an Aviation background and I understand the minute details. It was a 02 hour flight. But, the services commenced right from boarding. I personally loved the on-ground services. After Take-off, the carts were rolled out in 15 minutes(I mean WOW). The menu cards were distributed on-ground. It had our choice of meal for that particular time of flight and it was Hot Snacks. 

The food was piping hot, just like it should be and no shortage. Having complimentary food service is a wish come true for travellers. I know Jet Airways does it too, but Vistara had a personal touch and no frowning crew. It beat Jet and I'm very sure since I'm Ex-Jet crew. They have a tie-up with Starbucks for Tea/Coffee service. Now isn't that amazing? I mean which Airline does that. For those of you who could never afford/got the chance to sip Starbucks' Coffee/Tea, have thanked Vistara dearly.

I miss Kingfisher Airways, but now since Vistara has come up, I don't miss it that much. Vistara is clearly rising like Kingfisher did. The only thing missing is the IFE(In-flight entertainment) systems. To add, I'm Ex-Kingfisher crew too. It was my first airline and I still love it dearly.

Vistara, bravo to the entire team. You, practically, are number 1 Airline of India. And no sooner, Jet will realise that and up their game. Loved, loved, loved you guys. Please maintain the same standards. And if you guys are wondering who am I, then all the people who're reading this review, please note, I am not from Vistara. But, I did fly for other Airlines. And now, I'm a successful Interior Designer. Anyway, do fly Vistara, whenever you get s chance. Much love.",Domestic,5.0,N/A,4 December 2017,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Singapore Airlines replicated with India Girl,Kalimullah,New Delhi - Srinagar,"When we walked into the plane, it felt like Singapore Airlines replicated. Vistara, after all, is a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata, and it was a good experience when compared to some of the Indian airlines we have travelled on previously.  It was a new plane, smelt fresh and the seats were comfortable. The flight to Srinagar was short - one and a half hours - but the crew was attentive and helpful. We could not get sparkling water as apparently the plane only stocks still water; still they tried to be helpful, suggesting alternatives which we declined. The vegetarian food was nice. The only thing we found a little unsettling was that the crew allowed someone travelling in economy to stuff our overhead baggage compartment with a large backpack and a carry on bag, forcing us to find baggage space. Fortunately, the business class was not full and we managed to squeeze our one backpack in. When the plane landed, again, the crew did nothing to allow business class passengers to disembark first. Passengers from the economy section crowded the aisle as soon as the plane landed and it was a mad scramble - almost like travelling on Ryan Air or Airasia. When passengers pay extra for Business Class, they expect a little bit extra comfort. Other than that, it was a great airline.",Domestic,4.0,November 2017,29 November 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

I was shocked to get this rude reply , on one hand she offered the coffee and on other side said it is not ready in a rude manner. this is not anticipated from very young and bright airlines like Vistara. 

on one side these airlines or complaining about rude behaviour of passengers and introduced strict code of conduct and punishments for passengers but on other side there is no code of conduct for their unruly staff and no protection for passenger rights. it is really pity that one of the best airlines in India is behaving like this.",Domestic,3.0,November 2017,25 November 2017,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

The A320 on this route was new with a classy premium economy cabin that was actually partitioned from the rest of the economy class.  We were served cold towels and a drink prior to take off.  Had a great meal.  And the staff was excellent.

refined experience,Hoegaarden987,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"I was very interested in my first experience with Vistara, on an A320 between Hyderabad (HYD) and Delhi (DEL). I was seated in premium economy (PE). 

Check-in was smooth, and the agents were very polite and warm. PE comes with priority boarding, which was branded under the name of Vistara Priority, with a dedicated line at the gate. 

The aircraft had two rows of business class with 2-2 configuration, and several rows of PE just behind it with a 3-3 configuration. I liked very much that the aircraft had a fresh, new feeling. The seats were leather and very comfortable. 

A hot meal was served, which was more like a light snack. I chose vegetarian, which was tasty (unlike the mush that I frequently see in airplane food). The plate had a nice touch, with a golden thread tied around the napkin and utensils.

One thing I noticed different from other airlines (at least those that I have flied), is that passengers in economy were allowed to use the restroom in business. This is definitely not the case with my major carrier in North America, and I have rarely  seen this in other airlines as well. I liked this very much (although I did not capitalize on the opportunity). 

It seems that with PE comes priority handling of luggage. My luggage came out super quick, and I was off to my next flight in literally no time. All this for only CA$160, one-way!",Domestic,5.0,November 2017,17 November 2017,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

wanted to reschedule the flight from 1900hrs to the morning , ad says can do so by payning 1500/ buy they wanted to charge 4000/ for one flight and 2000/ for another flight which was higher than what is advertised

secondly the add says if u book online u can cancle or reschedule with zero charges , hence I asked for cancellation which wasn't free and the call centre girl bluffed it was 200/ , hence I agreed , after cancellation she said it was 4200/ and lied that she told 4000/ for the same

it took almost a week after many mails for them to finally mail to say that they wount refund the 4200/ charged forcefully from me

I take close to 90 domestic flights a year and never encountered any such issues where every single add and the staff lied through their teeth . .

Ground staff saved my flight,Siddhardha P,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"My first experience with Vistara will be memorable and also some personal lessons. I reached the BLR airport with a mobile boarding pass to learn from security personnel that it was not valid and they needed a printed copy. I was already late and ran to the check-in counter to be told that the boarding is closed.
Shocked and confused I pleaded the staff that I needed to board the flight to attend an important meeting in Delhi and that I'm already checked-in. The alert staff quickly made some calls and another lady staff quickly printed both my onward and return passes. The manager then made his assistant accompany me through a staff security route to quickly get to the boarding gate. 
I was the last passenger to board the plane to only see the door closed behind me and  aero bridge retract. I was so exhausted in the whole process that I could not note the names of the staff to thank them. But, I do thank them through this review for their alert and friendly gesture above and beyond their call of duty. 
Now on the in-flight experience, I must say that it was far better than the other airlines but only because it is a full service airline, so it would not be correct to compare it with an Indigo or Spicejet. But, the brand has lived up to its expectation with a differentiated service approach and with some good catered really tasty food.

Leg room is good in Economy seats also, much better when compared to so called budget airlines. Even though flight departed a bit late, but reached destination on time.

Flying above an economy,anmwanderlust,Mumbai - Srinagar,"Vistara, an airline providing 3 classes for Business, Premium economy and economy. I have travelled on premium economy, as it was affordable and didn't made a big hole in my pocket like business class.Must say, it provides a service better than economy and something nearer to business class experience apart from the seat comfort. 

Flights were on time in departing and landing, with minimal hassle in boarding's and security check-ins. The food provided is good with a cup of Starbucks coffee in beverage adding a brownie point to the same. Flight attendants are pleasant and helpful.

The only point of concern was cancellation charges, which is more than 50-60%, as mine was a pre-planned vacation, i was left with zero chance for rescheduling due to high cancellation charges..

Loved their service,nameetakashyap,New Delhi - Hyderabad,"After a long time loved an air service for flying within the country. First positive for us was that we could check in our luggage at the metro station itself so travelling ahead was easy. The leg space even in economy is much better than other aircrafts (except Air India as they also have decent space). Everything was working properly and things were neat and clean. Staff is good and friendly. The most positive things is their food. Loved both the veg and non veg versions. It is one of the best meals I had on flight.
Also their ground staff is good. In fact when shifting from an international flight to inter city flight they are very accommodating with the luggage weights even when Jet Airways is not even if you have flown international with them as well and this is connecting flight.

Initially I thought they will ask me to pay something for the upgrade but when they said it is free upgrade I was like that awesome I want that.
It was my first experience in premium economy and the seats were very comfortable with extra leg room space also the food was awesome I flew with Air India as well but I like Vistara food a lot better.

Excellent,vikrant s,New Delhi - Lucknow,"Vistara is known for class and whenever I travel it's never a disappointment. Best in class and full board flight is something that you know about vistara.

We flew from Delhi to Lucknow and again vice versa. Seats were cleaned and tidy and, one of the perfect hospitality by arwa, & Aishwarya. I always enjoy their non veg sandwich where as in veg is also pretty awesome.

No delay and most of the time before that adding  perfection to pilots and team.

This was my first experience travelling with kid so everything went well, however it would be good if one pay attention towards meal preference. While booking only I have requested for child meal which was missed. Thinking that we have already booked meal we didn't carry any  short of milk which was tense situation for us, however since it was short flight it didn't impacted much.

Crew informed they can serve the same food to them which is really a good gesture as sometime alternative work's. We took few cookies packets.

1. Aircraft: nice and clean with soothing interior  colour scheme with decent color led lights.
2. Seats: the leg room is good (at least for me) as compared to spicejet, indigo in economy class. Seats are also very comfortable.
4. Food: the BEST PART of Vistara. I never ever had such good quality and tasty food ever in flight (not in domestic & international).
5. Staff: staff is extremely polite, joyful. They give you so much respect. This not the plastic smile you will see in other flights. I will give 10+ for Ms. Sharhdha for her extremely polite and joyful service.

I am surprised to see AirAsia and Vistara both comes under TATA brand name but drastic difference in their services.

Glimpses of SQ,davidkwchong,Mumbai - New Delhi,"We arrived at the swanky new Terminal 2 of Mumbai Airport in good time. Checking in at Vistara's Business Class counter was a bit of a drag. Economy passengers were checked in without hassle while we waited at our counter. Apparently there was a systems error and they had to make several calls to verify I wasn't some militant, terrorist or something more sinister. After waiting aimlessly for a while we finally got our BPs and lounge invites and made our way to BOM's Terminal 2 GVK Lounge.

The main seating area upon entry has a nice vertical green and is in close proximity to the washrooms. You get tarmac views from the lounge. ​​Food was forgettable and before long we made our way to our gate.

Boarding was a funny affair as well, with no announcements and everyone boarding at the same time with no direction whatsoever from the ground staff. 

There were only 8 Business Class seats followed by a Premium Economy section then Economy class.
We were offered a very nice signature drink (not on the menu) to go with our starter soup & salad, chicken stuffed with Corn and Spinach and Mutton Kolhapuri finished with a Red Velvet Berry Mousse.

Landed in DEL on schedule and retrieved our luggage which were among the first to come out.
 
Thoughts: Check-in and boarding experience was definitely lacking, seats are ok, can see glimpses of SQ in the service methodology (the FA we chatted with confirmed that they are sent to Singapore for training).",Domestic,3.0,November 2016,13 September 2017,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I told as per Airlines / Security rules, one can carry one hand bag weighing 7 kgs and a computer which would weigh around 3 kgs. I told him that I was not carrying any computer and that he should allow, But, he was very obstinate and finally, I checked in the bag. 

He was not willing to listen to me and became rude after some time as he was not having an answer as how he allowed people with 10 kgs consisting of a bag and computer. It was so frustrating that his behavior would definitely make me rethink whenever I will book Vistara in future, though otherwise, the service quality of Vistara far superior than others!",Domestic,4.0,August 2017,13 September 2017,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0

I was also promised that the immediate available superior shall call me back, but never received any call.

Some brief summaries- 
-Flight took off and landed on time.
-Checkin was very quick and prompt. One of their customer service agents stood at the help desk assisting passengers for ticketing, queues, boarding passes etc.
-On board the flight, I was glad to see the clean and neatly maintained aircraft. I am extremely sensitive about cleanliness and hygiene. As I entered the aircraft, gazing on the pantry, garbage bin and drawers, I noticed them visibly cleaner. Head rests were clean too.
-Air hostesses were warm and professional in service. Hospitality was really genuine! And I mentioned it to them while alighting. Authentic hospitality is something that is missing from the industry of late and whenever I come across exceptional service I do make it a point to appreciate. Well done Neerja and Divya + team.

A great flight and Value for Money,tripvisitorMumbai,Amritsar - Mumbai,"I traveled on Amritsar- Mumbai Sector with family on June 17th 2017 (flight UK 736). It was my first on this sector as well as on Vistara. Below is my detailed feedback on this new experience. 

Check-in and Boarding: Check-in was very smooth and quick. I had web-checked in with printed boarding pass so it was just a bag drop. Airport is really shabby but that’s not Vistara issue. Flight time (i.e. Push back) was 16:15 but incoming flight (UK 735) landed only at 15:50 (15-20 mins late) so I was expecting a delay. But to my surprise boarding started at around 16:10 and we were seated by 16:20, doors armed by 16:30 and push back by 16:35. Unbelievable efficiency. Flight was almost full. 

Cabin and in-Flight - Air craft is a brand new A320 Neo and it was very clean with good interiors. I was travelling economy but still leg space and pitch length was good. I have seen really cramped pitches on some long distance international flights. We were captioned by a lady pilot (could not get her name) and even rest of the crew comprised of women except first officer. Otherwise we would have had an all women flight like the one AI operates on women’s day. Pilot announcement were clear and informative. Crew behavior warm and respectful. 

There was Tata as well as SIA touch of “customer first” attitude. That’s should remain a USP and differentiator.
Entire flight was very smooth except for some pre-informed turbulence during ascend. Cruising, descend and landing was very smooth. Convey my feedback to lady pilot if possible. You can easily figure out name by flight number and date. In spite of an initial delay, it was covered during cruising and we landed 5 mins early. As per flight navigation websites, Flight speed at cruising altitude was around 500 mph. Seems to be little high for a domestic flight but I am not an expert on that. Hope it is a safe speed for the class of the air craft. 

Food was good though quantity was a bit small. Overall it was great experience and I enjoyed every moment. Most important part was a brand image and its governance, customer first, safety, quality and not taken for granted attitude at the back of my mind.",Domestic,5.0,June 2017,15 July 2017,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Excellent Airlines in India (I prefer for all Domestic travels).,A K,Bhubaneswar - New Delhi,Vistara airlines is far better than any Indian domestic flights and all airlines companies need to think over and make necessary changes in future.

it shows that it is with Tata and Singapore Airlines,dkmitra2002,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),"a good airline. may not be a low cost carrier but the amenities and courtesy offered is worth paying extra. and i am not talking of free food and drinks.
right from web check in to landing at destination the care/thoughtfulness of the airlines shows. At the check in one does not have to struggle to load heavy bags on to the weighing platform, the loaders are there to help especially for the elderly and ladies.on the aircraft hostesses are helpful and smile welcoming you. the children are taken care of very well.they are provided with caps play items etc to keep them engaged.it does not cost much to provide for small travelers it is the thought behind that counts.
aircraft was clean and cool.departed on time in flight announcements were good and understandable.
i shall not talk about food service because it is not LCC. on landing near the carousel a airlines executive was supervising unloading of bags. when she noticed a single lady with two small children,she deputed one loadre to pick up bags and load them onto a trolley and even asked him to reach her upto exit gate. thanks Vistara.",Domestic,4.0,April 2017,29 June 2017,3.0,3.0,N/A,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Bad food,AnchitaP,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"We booked the Vistara flight a few months before our actual travel date. The reason for choosing it was simple - a timing that suited our needs and a cost within our budget.

The check in process at Bengaluru was smooth. We were coming back after a long vacation and were a little excess on luggage - for the 4 of us, the allowance was 60 kgs total, and our check-in baggage weighed 68 kgs. (we were very light on the hand-baggage though). The good thing was that the staff at the counter said that he would accommodate the excess baggage, even before we requested him for the same. 

The flight was like any other, maybe with a few inches more of leg room. But nothing to rave about. The flight was also on time - 8.50 PM was the scheduled departure.

As this is a full-service airline, we expected a good dinner. And yes, of course we were served food. We had the option to choose between veg or chicken biryani. We were told the menu was special because of Eid. Being biryani lovers, we were delighted to hear this. 

But when we opened our fancily packed boxes (yes, the packing was good!!), we were in for a major disappointment. The first thing we saw was some baingan (egg-plant) curry along with the rice! My first reaction was that the labeling had gone wrong and we had been served veg biryani. But then, while tossing the rice with the fork, we discovered a few tiny pieces of chicken. 

The first bite made me want to close the tray immediately. But I was hungry, (I tend to have my dinner early, and it was way past my usual dinner time) so I nibbled on some of it. Thankfully, the children had eaten a sandwich at the Bengaluru airport. My dear husband stayed hungry and ultimately ate something at the Delhi airport at 12 midnight. I still fail to understand how anyone could prepare such terrible biryani and serve it with baingan curry of all things!!

Then there was a small plastic bowl of sweet - looked like seviyan (vermicelli) in milk. Except that the dry seviyan was separate from the milk. It tasted a wee bit better than the biryani, but due to the overpowering cardamom flavor and nothing else to really go for it, nobody else had this either.

If this is the food they serve, I would rather pay for the food (here too we ""pay"", except that it is included in the ticket cost) and get stuff that I want to eat, like in airlines such as Indigo and Spice Jet.",Domestic,1.0,June 2017,28 June 2017,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

Perhaps this is a way to boost attraction and create customer loyalty, but I have had two trips with Vistara and I was impressed with their services onboard and on the ground. Immaculate, professional, warm and charming. I hope that Vistara will fly to destinations across India and it is important that they do not lose this fine service over time as we have witnessed the depleting services of some airlines which started out so well but now their services have become mediocre and disappointing.",Domestic,5.0,May 2017,28 June 2017,5.0,5.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Sadly, Jet is no longer what it was and one hopes that Vistara will not go the same way.

What is good about the airline is its sense of proportion. The courtesy one expects from a good airline is not excessive. The professionalism was evident at all touch points, with a 'human' element thrown in. The inflight experience was particularly enjoyable. The food was excellent and when an air hostess accidentally spilled a tray while serving me, she was quick and efficient in the manner in which she took care of the mess.

Comfortable and pleasing Journey with Vistara -Business Class with an exceptional hospitality and service standards,Krishnendu0101,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Pune,"This is my third time travel experience with Vistara Airline. Earlier I travelled on UK986 and UK985 on 2nd  (Seat 2A) of April and 8th  April 2017 (Seat 2D) respectively on Business Class. During that period I felt in love with Vistara’s world standard facility.  I enjoyed the high quality services rendered by the airline both at terminal as well as in-flight.

Today 22nd  April ,another Comfortable and pleasant journey I experienced with UK985 Business Class (Seat 2D and 2F). Earlier I travelled alone but this time me with my spouse and little angel (our 6months old daughter). I am not covering the part of check-in procedure or lounge experience at Kolkata airport but yes all the staffs of the airlines are quite polite and good in their service. 

We boarded the aircraft last as my intention was not to disturb my sleepy baby. As soon as we reached boarding gate one of the airline’s employee assisted us to board on the communicator bus to reach the aircraft to make the boarding smooth. We are welcomed with assorted Lime and guava juice and offered their business class menu card . This time the menu seems  different to me rather than the other domestic carrier’s Premiere/Business Class menu. This time the menu content authentic and delicious Fishfry and with Some Roll dishes along with choices of different flavor tea and with special Starbucks Coffee. I chose to go for Fishfry and my spouse for Veg roll delight along with Coffee.

The air hostess team was leading by Ms.Bharti and she was assisted by Leena. I must appreciate their effort to make our journey much more comfortable and pleasant specially for my angel. Bharti took the initiative herselves and prepared a lovely bed for my angel, Oh!! Really its so sweet of her and proved her caring nature. I must appreciate of Leena also to take care of us in every single moment. Thanks to Vistara to keep them on board for making our journey comfortable. 

Once we are settled over 37,000 feet and my angel was slept we are offered the food. We Enjoyed the food and specially I enjoyed the authentic and trendy Bengali fishfry along with chicken, BENGALI delicious GHUGNI (Bengali snacks dish made from Chana Daal with onions, coconut and flavor Bengali spices) along with Coconut water. Then we are offered with newly added Starbucks coffee. Oh! Really I loved it and had twice. As journey was only for 2.30 hours while we were enjoying service and refreshment, it was announced that we are planning to land in Pune shortly. Very good experience with Vistara, excellent staff, yummy food and overall wonderful flight I think Vistara is best airline in India according to me.

Bharti and Leena great job to make us more comfortable to travel with Air Vistara. It is a great experience overall and I shall look forward for flying with them again.I must appreciate the care you both took for my little Angel.

Yes, the landing was good and as our luggage was tagged with Golden Priority badge. We received the luggage as soon as the conveyer belt start working. The priority badge works nicely for us. It took hardly 10 minutes for us to collect luggage and to move on to arrival gate to board on the Car to move towards my home.

WORLD CLASS SERVICE WITH A SMILE, Last but not the least, it was a pleasure to see pleasant faces serving with a smile, all around, whether at check in or in the flight.

Arrogance and low training of in flight Crew,S N S,Mumbai - New Delhi,"I happen to be unfortunately a Platinum Member of Vistara which happens to be the highest status a flier can attain in any frequent flier program of an Airline.
There have been few good and few not so good experiences with this new airline for me 
On yesterday's flight I found the Cabin Crew extremely casual careless and arrogant. It goes like this at the time of dinner service I tld the Crew that I wanted to go to wash room and I may be served later. The Crew insited to serve dinner and told me to go to wash room later . 
I said in such case I do not wish to take dinner. 
when I went to the wash room in front zone  this crew told me to wait at my seat 6F as another crew member was in cockpit and for security reasons I will have to wait and I can not go to Wash Room till she comes out . 
I am really surprised at this  why the other key member had to be for so long in Cockpit and how a passenger in wash room is a security risk . 
I also wish to know as to what is the reason that I was forced to take dinner and hold from going to wash room  in a situation when there was no seat belt sign  the flight has more than an hour of flying time and also as why no one approached and asked me serve me after I came back from wash room 
Why an airline of this repute treats a Platinum member as  a MILD STEEL category .
Very bad and sickening experience .
TATA's enterpriseare pride of nation and  are not expected to have such a poor way of service
I will only travel Vistara if I do not have any other flight option... It will be better to travel more with Air India the national Carrier where I am a Gold Member or Jet where I am a Platinum Member ...The name, Vistara, is drawn from the Sanskrit word ‘vistaar’, which means limitless expanse. I have few very bad experiences some of which I have reported and have a very careless Customer feed back   the fact is that there’s no limit to arrogance poor service and being at a limitless bad performance ......

It transpired that my online booking  had somehow been duplicated and I had been sent 4 tickets instead of two.   Vistara agreed a refund of unused tickets but all they did was credit me with just under £20 when I had paid in total over £700.  I am now over £300 out of pocket. My credit card company say because I have received a refund even though far below what I expected they cannot do anything.

Though delay was not welcome, Vistara had arranged for a complementary lunch to all it's guests travelling by that flight. Lunch was nice and in the mean time the flight was rescheduled 3 more times to a final 3:30 PM departure. Did some plane spotting during my stay there and finally my plane arrived at the gate. I was welcomed to a clean and well maintained aircraft by some most cheerful and pleasant staff. The cabin crew made sure of a real quick boarding of pax and doors were closed within a short period of time. The plane then crawled through the congested Mumbai airport and we got airborne at 4:20 PM. A short while into the flight, the famed food service started. We were served with some lip smacking pav and chicken keema along with some fruits and choco brownie. All the pax were kept engaged by serving one thing after the another.

Cant recommend them due to its unruly customer service!,Mand26,Bengaluru - Kolkata (Calcutta),"It was my first flight with Vistara from Kolkata to Bangalore, and to be honest I was quite sceptical at the very first moment. It went all very nice starting from pleasant crew behaviour, with good/average inflight food, reaching on time. And I was very happy and decided to fly back with Vistara again. And there I did the mistake it seems. As usual I did web-check in and booked my preferred aisle seat beside my brother. At the onset problem started, just 15 mins before scheduled boarding time they declared its running late and finally it took off nearly 1 hr late and suppose to reach Kolkata post mid night. Post boarding I tried to take a nap after a long tiresome day, and I heard my co passenger insisting me to change my seat with his. I politely declined the request. It didn't stop there, I found one crew member started pushing and arguing me why can't I change my seat with the co-passenger?? I replied her that I am not interested to do so and if she is so sympathetic about other passenger why can't she upgrade the passenger to vacant business class seats ( all business seats were lying vacant ).

She promptly responded, no mam , its of higher cost. I said if you know that, you better should also understand while trying to help one passenger, a crew is not suppose to irritate and force other passengers to change already allocated seats. After my strong denial she stopped, and finally shifted that passenger to some back side seats.
Food served as a dinner was no less, it couldn't even fill the stomach of a child!

I was surprised at this crew's behaviour in spite of running 1 hour late in night, they were in no mood to apologize rather with so much zest to help one passenger, they forgot about the convenience of other passengers. What sort of priority sense this airlines have I am wondering!!",Domestic,2.0,February 2017,1 March 2017,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Excellent service,prabal s,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bengaluru,"In the current domestic airline services available in India Vistara has stood out to be one of the best. A new comer in the service has been really good with its services. The seats have enough leg space and also the head rest does folds in to provide rest sideways too. 

In food they do start with juice followed with Veg/Non Veg food. The food was hot and also of good quality. The air hostesses were really friendly and helpful. There were instances when a glass of juice fell because of a kid and the air hostesses were really prompt to clean and also provide another glass of juice. Also these food items are all included in the ticket charges. So they are free as the ticket prices are quite similar or even less than Indigo and others. 

They do maintain time and are quite punctual with take off and landing. In fact i reached half an hour before time.

These all additional services might be provided to attract customers in the starting but would suggest Vistara to keep providing these services so that they can hold on to there customers as well. 

Other classes do provide more leg space and better food facilities.",Domestic,4.0,December 2016,1 March 2017,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,N/A,3.0,4.0
"No one will help u in emergency, highly untrained staff",RBan26,New Delhi - Lucknow,"Fortunately the accident did not happen with me but unfortunately it happened with the passenger sitting just in front of us. He was sitting in the middle seat. Before takeoff his aisle neighbour was working on laptop. The on duty air hostess almost snatched his laptop and threw it on the cabinet above as the aircraft had started moving before his laptop was completely switched off. She had actually put the laptop vertically (most inappropriate way to keep such a heavy electronic item in a moving wagon). It shows to what extent they lack in basic training. Even a common man knows about the hazards of keeping it in such a risky way. 
When the flight landed, as the laptop owner stood up, the man seating in the middle chair shifted to the aisle seat by then. Just as the other person standing in front opened the cabinet, the laptop fell over this man's head very badly and he started bleeding heavily. We all were shocked to see him bleeding that way. But even after crying for multiple times, none of the crew members came along for help. The passengers helped the victim to the airport to see a doctor. Mind you, he was bleeding very heavily. But the doctor (we doubt whether he was even an MBBS) said right away it was a minor injury. He did not even care to do a xray. And needless to say the flight crew disappeared in no time. The doctor was only interested in washing his hands off from the case, always trying to push the victim out of the airport premises at the earliest.
It was our first flight with vistara. If this is the level of training and support by flight crew, then why do u employ them? DO we really need so many goodlooking heartless humans inside the flight? Better u remove them asap and increase our baggage weight limits. It will actually help the passengers.

Rubbish airlines,Shourjendra D,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Utterly rubbish airlines. Dont really know why people here are going ga-ga over it.

The only good feature is its 20% more legroom than other LCCs,but apart from that its rubbish. 
Firstly,it's never on time. unlike Indigo, it is always delayed. I traveled on a Vistara flight in the late afternoon from Kolkata to Delhi. It started pulling away a good 10 mins delayed,then waited at the runway,and then left Kolkata nearl;y 15 mins late than scheduled.
The air hostesses are a smiling lot, but it is all fake. Indigo or Spice airhostesses do not smile, here they do smile and say 'welcome aboard,Sir' but that is about it. Their body language says 'get on with it,I am off in the next port of call,so please hurry""

The seats are slightly better than other Low Cost Carriers. Business class seats are wider with wider armrest. Premium economy are slightly inferior,and economy seats are same as in other LCCs. Only thing is that they provide a headrest in the economy seats, that's all. The utterly ridiculous and nonsensical thing is that after airborne, the air hostesses pull curtains and SEGREGATE premium economy and business class from Economy. So firstly you can;t see anything in the front of the aisle. Secondly, nobody can go to the washroom. So if you are seating on the 16th/17th row, which is right in the middle of the plane, it means you have to walk all the way to the rear of the plane , just to pee !! Ridiculous ! 
I always do a web check in, for any flight that I take. Here, even when the flight was ready for web check in, I couldn't take any seat before row 16 !! The 1st 15 rows are business class and premium economy !! I always prefer and get seats in row 4 or 5 on Indigo. I air travel every month,and vouch that I will never get back on Vistara again. Utterly stupid of Vistara to do something like this.
On top of that,I could not get a seat of my liking,on the return flight,till 48 hours from the time,the flight actually took off. This never happens on other LCCs
I went to Mumbai in January,and was on Indigo. From my Kolkata home,I did web check in for both my onward and return flights,and took the printed boarding cards with me. While this time,in February 2017, while going to Delhi and coming back,I could take a print out of my onward flight,but the return flight kept on saying ""not yet ready for check in"" ! Disgusting and impractical. Finally as I was staying in a 5 star hotel in Delhi,and the hotel lobby had few MACS with a laser printer, I could get a print out of my return flight boarding card.

The food served on board in Vistara,is ridiculous and appalling to say the least. On my flight to Delhi,after being airborne, we were served a sour orange juice. Then after that, we were approached for food. Shamefully, there was no choice. All the LCCs have inflight magazines,and on that you can pinpoint your choices and then tell the stewards. Here the inflight magazine was devoid of any food options. Actually there was NO OPTION OF FOOD except Veg/Non veg - how appalling !! I asked for a Non veg food - and was served a bed of chickpea like stuff with two over-cooked samosas on them. Who on Earth has heard of this kind of rotten food ??? Are we paying for our food or not ?? Vistara, are you listening ? This is the last time, I am on Vistara, whatever people here say ! Give me options man, I am paying for it ! Absolutely nothing except this ridiculous dish and a cup of tea. That's it.

Same happened on my return flight (UK719 ) from Delhi, IGI Airport. The scheduled departure time was 20.10, but boarding started as late as 20.00 hrs. Later plane took off at about 20.20. Later same sour orange juice,no other option in economy. They didn't bother to tell anybody, when a kid in the front row,asked for apple juice,which was grudgingly served after some time. Since it was a late night flight (Kolkata arrival was 22.30 hrs ), they served dinner. Again a disgusting slob of green chicken with palang and some bits of jeera rice and a broth of rajma !! Terrible. Thank God I didn;t puke. The pudding served with it, as desser was bitter and tasted funny as well. Me and my colleague actually didn't eat and later had dinner at home

TATA Sons, no doubt all your businesses are going down the drain and all your business ventures are at a shocking loss making state. Sincerely hope, SIA ( Singapore Airlines ) understand their folly soon and end the joint venture with TATA Sons asap. This is horrible. Service is horrible.

Well as I entered the plane it looked different, they have a VIP class and another class that is between VIP and economy. They call this Premium Economy, this is with xtra leg space.
I was prepared for a boring 2+ hour flight and as usual had booked a exit seat. But my seat was snatched by a couple, they wanted to sit together, and I had to loose. 
Then I realised that in Vistara the leg space on all the seats are good, so no need to book the exit seats for carrying your legs with you.
I was surprised when the crew started serving orange juice on arrival.
The food packaging is excellently done and food served is good, I had custard in the dessert. It was simply fantastic. Never had this yummy custard earlier.

while giving onboard service non veg was over after 3 or 4 rows. On request they gave some Veg food which was also not good.",Domestic,2.0,January 2017,6 February 2017,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0

Worst Experience,rahuld,New Delhi - Pune,"Dear Team,
Please note it was the worst experience which I ever had in my life. It was my first & in fact last flight with Air Vistara. Please find the issue below which happened with me step wise:
1)	Booked the flight from your official website considering that I was able to select my seat well in advance.
2)	Flight was at 10:40 but got proponed to 10:15. Perfectly fine with me considering the weather condition in north India during this time.
3)	Reached the airport at 8:20 (almost two hours prior to take off) & waited for 30 minutes in line for my turn because of rush at the airport.
4)	At 8:50 reached the counter and showed my ID and ticket to Mr. Yashwant (or similar name) who was there to take my check-in & he allocated me a seat somewhere in the back row upon investigating with him I come to know that the seat which was booked by me has been allocated to someone else and when I asked why it has been allocated to someone else the reply which I got was totally unprofessional, he said sir we thought you will not be coming so that’s why your seat has been allocated to someone else??? Are you kidding me the ticket which was booked by me was on BNX basis then how can you allocate the seat to someone else, you should preferred it to be a No-show instead of allocating to someone else but then again he changed his statement and said no sir since you were late your seat has been given to someone.

How can you say that I was late when as per the policies you need to report 40 min prior to your departure for domestic flight??????

5)	Now, comes the hilarious part he asked me to get side so that he can take other check-in. Fine understood considering the busy rush hours but for next 20 min there was no follow up for my ticket and the gentlemen was busy in doing his work and at 9:20 when I asked him what is the status he told me he is checking it and it was when I shouted on him and told him that I will put this on social media then a lady might be Supervisor (totally clueless of the situation) came and told me sorry sir your seat has been given to someone else considering we thought you will not be coming so that’s why your seat has been allocated to someone else???
Again the same lame excuse, who asked you guys to thought whether I will be travelling or not????
6)	Now, after 10 minutes came Mr. Himanshu this gentleman gave me another stupid reason that sir it was a system error and that’s why your seat has been allocated to someone else common man how can this be happen. Also this guy was not having the information of what his colleague have already told me and then somehow they managed to get &A for which I agreed considering I was getting late as it was already 9:35 at the check-in counter.

There was no compensation offered to me by this gentlemen forget about the compensation he didn’t even apologies for the blunder which they had done. It was because of their lame excuses and lack of co-ordination in between the team members that it took almost 45 min to allocate a seat which was pre booked by me if you guys cannot honor a request please remove the option of selecting the seat from your side so that it will be more convenient to guest whether to go with Vistara or some other airline which are offering the same services in the same price.

Also what I observe during this 45 minute is that your Staff at T3 requires more training as they all look like a fresher and same is getting reflected at way they handle the customer.

Anyways thank you for giving me such a wonderful experience which I will not forget and will always think of it before booking a ticket with Vistara!!!!!!

Best domestic airlines,Tanmoy D,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),In my choice vistara is the best domestic airlines in India. Their every flight is new.

Early days doesn't excuse sloppiness,Veeresh M,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"I've done about half-a-dozen flights on Vistara and each flight there's been some minor glitch or the other which is more a reflection on controls over staff and supplies than anything else. The senior management of this airline appear to be full of themselves and this attitude appears to have a trickle down to the rest of the staff downstream.

I've had dairy creamer that was 6 months old, seats and seat pockets not cleaned from previous sector, rude check-in staff - and all this usually on Premium Economy - for which I don't think I am going to pay premium prices anymore.

Vistara may do well in the future, once they have more aircraft in their kitty, as of now they run fewer routes and schedules than their competition and their frequent flyer programme is difficult to figure out too.",Domestic,4.0,November 2016,4 February 2017,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0

premium econ seat,Kat T,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,"One way COK->DEL flight. Chose the airline primarily because of the price (7200 INR in total) and good departure time from COK (1835h), as compared to other airlines' offerings (many of them more expensive, and also departing early afternoon -- so for a leisure traveler hoping to make the most of available sunlight hours, taking the Vistara flight offered more hours of play time for a lower cost.) Took the premium economy class seat when it happened to be close to the price of a standard economy class seat, although it was the same seat width and food. 

Onboard, the seats were comfortable enough. One noticeable thing was that it did not have AVOD, at all. For most domestic flights (1-2 hours) this should be fine. This being India, and COK to DEL in particular, the flight was 3.5 hours. I slept through all this time except to eat, but other travellers may have wished for some entertainment.   

Food was excellent. Same food as economy, but in both cases the taste and portions were as good as international carriers. If memory serves, the premium economy seats had better seat pitch. 

Would certainly consider taking this airline and class of cabin again, though wondering whether it offers code-share with foreign-operated international airlines. Did not notice other flight numbers which may have indicated that the flight was code-shared.",Domestic,5.0,January 2017,2 February 2017,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Wonderful Experience,SinghCzar,New Delhi - Mumbai,This is an excellent airline. I have flown it several times. I just want to recount the experience in premier Economy. Normally if you have booked economy you can request upgrade by two ways. a) Standby for Rs 1500 for Del-Mumbai or confirmed for about Rs 3000/--On one ocassion i have got upgrade on standby but was not lucky in 2nd time. However whenever you book on Vistara go to their website and on two ocassions i found that the Premier Economy fare LOWER than economy and i quickly booked. Done that twice with success.

And the change has been far more than refreshing. Even before I took my first experience, I booked tickets for my wife and my 8 month old son, knowing well that they are going to be in the best hands. I just couldn't hold myself back, and booked myself a return ticket (B'lore - Delhi - B'lore) and my first leg was on Diwali night. The memory of that journey is going to last forever with me.

The flight was a little delayed due to bad weather but it was very nicely handled by the ground crew.
The only thing not so great was the staff at check-in counter. They looked a bit in panic mode. For example, one of the staff was putting a tag on my check-in luggage while I was waiting in the line & a counter just become available. The staff directing the customers to counters came to me & said in a tone to go the counter like I was boarding the plane late. It just took half an minute more with my luggage & I was standing at the counter. I didn't understand the panic there. The airline should take notice as this is the first time a customer interacts with the airline & if the staff here is not that great, the starting experience goes for a toss & it may affect the overall experience.

I found it just like any other airlines so the fare is not justified. May be they are charging for Brand. 

May be they charge extra for meal served on flight I was disappointed.

I travelled on 10 Dec and then 19 Dec. However even after nine days, their menu was same chickpeas and bread (kulcha) which was soaked with chhole so got soggy. Though packaging was good, this aspect has to be looked into

Best flying experience in Indian skies,Pranjal,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"India's newest airline and India's best at the moment. Being new means Vistara flies limited routes but it is rapidly expanding. Great service and even better food. Love the desserts they give with the food. 

Lovely choice of colour - aubergine matches their stated ambition of being India's premium airline. Beats Jet Airways hands down on service, food and on-time performance.  I have flown Vistara a few times now and it's been on-time or whereabouts every single time. 

Also, they just relaunched their frequent flier programme - Club Vistara. Felt shortchanged though by some benefits which could not be applied retrospectively to old Club Vistara members, but otherwise waiting to see how this FFP turns out. They have limited tie-ups at the moment. That said, it's just been 2 years so kudos to it anyway.

"Good Food, Bad Legroom",Arijit S,Bengaluru - Kolkata (Calcutta),"This was my first flight with Vistara. While booking ticket - I opted for seat 7A - thinking, it will be just after the premier class - hence I will get the first row in economy & hence a bit space for stretching. But the saga started when I reached Kempegowda Airport. 

(1) Firstly, though I had done web check-in, I didn't manage a printout. So, was searching for Kiosk Print. But none of the kiosk had Vistara option for Kiosk print.
(2) So, was searching for the Vistara counter - which was not available at that time (well, I had reached a tad ahead of time)
(3) After the wait - had a smooth check-in (i.e. got the boarding pass). Staff at counter was very friendly/cordial
(4) Boarding process was well maintained & pretty smooth
(5) But as I entered the flight, I realized there were 3 segments in the flight i.e. Business, Premium Economy & then Economy & no physical division per se.They were separate by curtains. 

My observations:
- Business & Premium Economy were nice - as expected. With enough legroom.
- But as the economy started, they did appear claustrophobic.
- Service by on-board crew was fine
- Food served was good in quality (but perhaps they could have saved on the exterior decoration & invested that on bringing up the portion size)
- Food tray - was too narrow to maneuver

Conclusion:
- Since I got a good price/deal - I managed. But the journey was difficult. 
- So, if you prefer a bit of space, go for Premium or Premium Economy
- Do I recommend this? Hmnn...I am still not decided!",Domestic,4.0,November 2016,20 November 2016,2.0,3.0,N/A,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

A few pointers:
- I had requested for a child meal but apparently they didnt have any - then why have that option on the site? The regular meal was too spicy for my 6yr old and they did not have any other options which I could offer my child - very disappointing.
- My child had a bad ear ache on descend, I requested for a bottle of water to help her and I was told ""I will be right back"" - that right back never happened.

The seats are very comfortable with decent leg room I found the inflight service very efficient. the meals were better than a standard economy.I really enjoyed the experience. 

I also wanted to enrol for the Vistara-Axis bank Loyalty card and applied. However the terms are not great at all. I wanted to get on to the Gold membership as advertised in the inflight magazine. The terms are not comparable with other tagged programs such as Amex-Jetairways platinum. i was left wondering why on earth anyone will apply for the top end Vistara card.If you are serious to get members Axis bank and Vistara has to come out with a better deal of lower membership fee @ Rs 10,000.

Simply Great,Nakul D,New Delhi - Guwahati,Vistara the name was very uncommon to me when I booked the tickets. I told my mom that she will not get any free staff to eat during the flight. My mom was a strict vegetarian (no onion and garlic) and it's very difficult to arrange food for her outside my home. I was surprised when the announcement came that they would serve free meal during the flight. I ordered non-veg and reluctantly ordered Veg meal for mom assuming it would be of onion and garlic. But i was shocked to find that mon was eating the meal. I asked her when did you started taking onion. Mom smiled and said that it was pure veg meal. I was relaxed and it gives me immense Joy looking at her enjoying the meal.  Thanks Vistara!...,Domestic,5.0,October 2016,19 October 2016,4.0,4.0,N/A,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
Best domestic airline in India and Amazing Lounge at IGI Airport,Nikhil M,New Delhi - Goa,"As I arrived to Delhi Airport from New York via Emirates, I had a 5-6 hour layover to kill before my flight with my family to Goa. We purchased an entrance to the Vistara lounge at IGI Airport which was cheaper than staying in a nap lounge or the holiday inn inside the airport. It was well worth it, very nice lounge chairs and amazing staff/service. The food was amazing as well ( I ate as much as I could). This truly felt like a Taj Hotel experience (which makes sense since the airline is partially owned by TATA). The only thing that I would say the lounge can improve on is having it's own free WIFI service like other lounges do. I didn't have an India sim card at the time and it was a little frustrating to only use the Airport wifi which has extremely limited service unless you pay for a premium and it is only enabled in a short amount of time. I hope this is implemented in the future. The flight itself was great and staff was very nice. I also think the plane should also have wifi and inflight entertainment to stay ahead in the domestic airline market in India. In America, many domestic airlines have WIFI onboard already. Other than those things I highly recommend flying Vistara after flying pretty much all Domestic airlines in India, if you have a long layover I also highly recommend paying for the Vistara lounge",Domestic,5.0,October 2016,18 October 2016,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

BED EXPERIENCE IN BOARDING & RUDELY EXPERIENCE FROM AIR HOSTES,Ashwin P,Guwahati - Ahmedabad,"Hello Vistara Family, 

Good evening!!!

There was two bad experience with Visatara Family.‎
(1) We travelled 19 people from Delhi to Guhawati ‎ on date: 9th October 2016. In Checking time, it was too slow, we cannot explain for that,it took almost 30-35 mins only for getting our boarding pass.I think may be crew was new joining and because of that  we were getting late for security checking and we couldn't even check our  Bording pass, one of our member got different flight and She was travelling with her baby boy. It was shameless of you because we have already told that crew she was travelling with us and link that ticket with us. And because of late Checking we can not check flight number, why we cannot check?? Because we trusted you, we trust Vistara Family. Now we understand that never trust Vistara. ‎MY PNR NO 4G0IFZ DELHI TO GAUHATI

On 11th October 2016, we were coming back to home From Guhawati to Ahmedabad.‎ Also 19 people journey together but now this time, it was highly experienced with Priancy (air hostess of Vistara). Our family member Mr. Monil Zota open the luggage box , she was came and shut that box very badly and after that she argue with us that why you open the luggage box. We explain that a baby boy was crying, we getting some sancks for a baby boy after the explanation, she cannot find her fault, we told incharge crew, on that time she also argue I cannot do that, I shut that box slowly. If she shut that box slowly you can also cross check with other travellers and  crew members also. After that she was very rude behaviour with us all the journey time. Now you tell us, why we should travel with you? Why?? Your crew member cannot be cooperative. You cannot do Group Checking as other airlines do and give us best priority for group checking.  MY PNR NO 4GXDSY GAUHATI TO AHMEDABAD

After all over we are not going to travel with vistara Airline because it was too bad experience. And we thought that we are not going to travel with you, if you giving us free ticket, complimentary letter, Gifts etc. We cannot travel with you and also our friends and other family members. ‎Thank you so much for such a Memorable and experience travelling.

But it's not just the national carrier to be blamed par se, the full carrier premium airlines like Jet airways compete in incompetence overall too. 

Having said all this, and starved of choices, the shiny new Vistara is quite a respite. It brings in the Tata value that we are all pampered with, you will know what I mean if you're a Taj Hotels baby.

I rang their call centre in India and was told that both flights had been cancelled. I asked how they had informed us and they said  by text. When I said no such text had been received despite them having the correct number on the booking he suggested it might be because it was a UK mobile phone number. No email confirmation of cancellation had been received despite them having correct email address.

 Despite having cancelled both flights they had kept the money I had paid them.

I obviously asked for the full refund and they said that it would take ten days before this could be enacted because it was an international credit card. Interestingly there was no such delay when paying for the tickets.

At DEL airport, I could not find any pointers/boards regarding the check-in counter opening time. The Check-in had Air-India uniforms probably this was outsourced to Air-India. How can a airline outsource a people dependent job to Air-India staff. 

The process at gate was smooth. Seeing the Air-hostesses one gets the feeling that they are freshers and this is their first airline cabin job. The person who was making the announcement spoke Hindi with an heavy English Accent. The hindi announcement on Swiss Airlines flight was more genuine that Vistara's.  

Food was good. The flight was quiet and take-off was smooth. Landing was relatively smooth considering the weather conditions at BBI.",Domestic,5.0,August 2016,10 September 2016,4.0,5.0,N/A,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

2.awesome food which includes in flight fair.
3.the inflight wifi system to which you can connect n watch movie or series they have, plus newspaper n the hospitality.
4. very smooth flying experience.
cons

A Memorable Flight,Ashraf383,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),"I was not feeling well and when the airhostess want me to select the food, I told I dont want and fell into sleep, much before take off. After 2 hours,  I saw my seat was reclined, all the four rows window shutter downed and I had been covered with a blanket. When I woke up after 2 hours of flight, the cabin crew gave me desert, which was very good, and yet another airhostess came and asked me whether she can get me a lemonade specially made for me. They made me so happy, by the time I landed in Kochi, my fever flew away. If I rightly remember some of the names, it was Sonam, Priyanka and 2 others. Special thanks to them all.

Hyderabad to Delhi Oneway,Jawad H,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"My second experience after flying Indigo to Hyderabad from Delhi.  The return flight with Vistara was a pleasant surprise.

I was not expecting a hot meal on a domestic private airline and we got a hot meal.  The staff was helpful and friendly,  the aircraft were clean and new, the seats were comfortable and there was good legroom.

The only thing I found irritating is having to go through security, opening hand luggage again before boarding the aircraft when you have already gone through the long lines at check in and the long and slow security at the airport.  Maybe the date of travel being 14 August, day before Independence day may have been a factor in the additional check.",Domestic,4.0,August 2016,7 September 2016,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0

Secondly, the flight was delayed by an hour and neither he informed nor the boarding gate informed me of the same. Made to sit there for a long time and unsure whether I had time for a quick meal, we boarded and the flight served insufficient quantity of food though it is my understanding that most full service airlines serve lunch if they are airborne between 12.00 pm and 2.00 pm. All they served was a snack. Also they had no system for a passenger to pay for and upgrade himself either at Chandigarh or at the Gate at New Delhi.

Refreshing change!!,dvrahul,Mumbai - Goa,"After hearing so much about new Tata-Singapore airline venture, i decided to fly the new Vistara to Goa. After my first flight, i must say, they have won me over with their no-nonsense and efficient customer service approach.

Booking was done through a travel aggregator portal. On-line check-in was seamless. if you are an iPhone user, you get a boarding pass option for the wallet on your phone (I don't know if any other Indian airline company has this option. It is so convenient and cost effective and saves paper)

Airport reps were of pleasing personality and efficient. baggage drop was quick. planing process was systematic and once in the plane, the crew were welcoming and helpful. Captain's welcome was warm with flight weather and ETA communicated to all flyers.

Food was a sandwich, cookie, mango beverage - decent at best. cannot complain. crew was quick to disburse snacks and clearance as well.

Seat was comfortable. legroom was just right (i'm 6 feet tall). The magazine content was mediocre say when compared to Jet wings of Jet airways. I would like to see better content.

The most horrible experience ever.,mustusb,Goa - Mumbai,"Vistara being a JV between the Tata's and SIA, I had very high expectations.

But I was shocked to note the level of service before the flight.

First, my flight from Bombay to Goa was cancelled and they informed me only 2 days prior to ETD. The shocking bit was I had to make several calls to their customer service to convince them to put us on another airline on the same departure date, given that I had back to back hotel and flight bookings.

On my return from Goa, when we reached the airport, I was once again shocked to note that they had suspended our ticket! The reason being that the ticket was booked on an international credit card. We had to wait till their Delhi office could unblock the tickets after verifying my credit card!

That was not the end of our plight! The flight was delayed by an hour!

I have given Vistara 2 stars as the flying and in flight experience was great. Their level of pre flight services is horrible.

I will try never to fly Vistara again and would not recommend this airline to anyone. If you still want to fly Vistara, do so at your own risk.

Since I had web[-checked in it took less than a minute to enter the revised gate number. The boarding process was quick as I preferred to board last. 

After a warm welcome by the crew and settling down the push back was delayed due to the use of the Secondary Runway but the Captain kept the guests fully informed.

The take-off was smooth but there was a bit of turbulence. The food service began once the cruise was normal. I got a good feeling after the meal that this airline does care for the guests but offering the right quantity of food.

Eerily Familiar: In the Image of Indian Airlines,N H,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),"It was my first experience of Air Vistara and it began ominously.  The security at the airport gate refused me entry saying my web-checkin pass did not carry my name!  Well, after a visit to the counter I finally got in.  I had to wait for over 10 minutes just for a baggage drop.  The boarding took even longer with an additional elaborate security check by the airlines staff at the aircraft door.
I had taken care to book a seat in the economy first row.  But i was in for a shock.  Instead of having wider leg room, this row is more cramped as the premier class (something between business and economy) takes away extra space.  
The announcements were with a strong accent making it largely incomprehensible.  The refreshments were oh-so-familiar: dal and rice, dahi and a dessert.  Since my journey had two sectors, the refreshment in the second sector had the same dessert, a lemon mousse/custard.  
The only saving grace was that the flight was on time which means a lot.  But it is also a little worrisome to note how much the airlines reminded one of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, the food, the announcements, even the interior decor.  Finally, the stewardesses' attire could have been better designed: it resembles a pajama suit!
I booked on it only because it had the cheapest ticket going, but next time i have to think twice.

A delightful experience,Vikash Bajaj,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Flew from Delhi to Mumbai on the 29th of June 2016. After the experience flying low cost airlines, the Vistara experience was a very pleasant one.

Though the flight was delayed due to inclement weather, the in flight experience more than made up for the delay. The extra leg space as well as the wonderful continental meal was a major departure from what we get in the other airlines.

As expected, the aircrafts are new and the staff are fresh, but there is a certain peppiness to the whole in-flight atmosphere. The uniforms are smart, functional and different in colour, makes the in-flight crew perform their activities without worrying too much about 'adjusting' their appearance. The seats are the w-i-d-e-s-t in this business. Food - most delicious, hot and packaged neatly, even their cutlery area notch above other plasticy options. Fares are comparable to any competitor. In-flight crew are friendly, compassionate and one can feel the warmth of our national airline many years ago.

Since it is a fairly new airline with a brand new fleet of aircraft, the interiors were impeccably spic & span. Was warmly greeted by very well groomed cabin crew, I love the uniforms too, practical to work in and elegant at the same time. The business class cabin I flew in was spacious, I love the overall purple & dull gold colour scheme of the seats and not using cloth as the upholstery instantly ups the luxury of the cabin interior. We had a decent selection of meals & drinks presented on printed menu cards. Although the food tasted average, the warm service provided by the Cabin Crew was really a pleasure. They interacted with me on a personal level, I felt like a guest, not just another pax. Lavs were spotless as well. The galley was kept neat all through the flight.

One of the unprofessional and terrible behaviour,kuns87,Mumbai - Kochi (Cochin),We were group of 4 couples flying from mumbai to cochin  for our honeymoon trip to kerala. We were travelled from ahmedabad to mumbai in another Airline. That day there were heavy raining in mumbai so due to traffic condition in mumbai airport our flight landed 30 mins delay. And we were rush to departure for check in at vistara airlines departure point. As we have reach at last minute the attendant was about to print our boarding pass one of the manager comes and told boarding has been close. We were know that due to heavy rain our mumbai cochin vistara flight will also get delay. So we argue with the manager a lot finally after 15 minutes of argument he told that he will allow only passengers not our luggage. And finally we have to decide that 2 of the people will left over with all of the luggage at mumbai only. And rest of us rush to the flight. Later we come to know that flight was already 1hour delay. So once we reach to the aircraft we told our colleges that flight will depart 1 hour later why he should allow our luggage and all of us. So they go to the manager and fight with words but he still didn't allow them to board. Very rude and unfriendly behaviour of the airline staff.

Mr. Anish Garf,Anish Garg,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Hello,
I am Anish Garg. My Pnr was 6NIJU8.I travelled to Mumbai from New Delhi in flight UK943 departed from New Delhi at 07:35 am on 25 May 2016.
This was my 3rd experience with Vistara.
But this time the experience was pathetic. I was happy to get upgraded to premium economy class at the time of check in. But onboard the things are quite different. In 2 hour flight i got the meal 80 minutes after take off. And the crew expect me to have that meal in 10 minutes so that they can clear on time. And they started clearing when the aircraft is preparing for landing and changing directions. All the food basket and trays are falling and they are unable to control.
I was shocked to see that. I didn't expected this type of hospitality from Vistara. The crew members should be trained enough.
I will have to rethink about traveling with Vistara again. Very disappointed.

Great Hospitality - Best comfort,Richa S,Mumbai - Srinagar,"Well from where do i begin with, its very difficult to mention the great service / facility and hospitality provided by Vistara family. we really had a good time flying with them. Aircraft is very Spacious and equipped with good facilities and has simple yet elegant interiors. seats were very comfortable, even for kids. Pilots and crew members were much professional. they knew their role perfectly, and living upto the expectations. be it safety instruction / warning, serving meals, providing any help to kids or adults, older people. Pilots were very proficient that while our journey from delhi to Srinagar, climate wasnt good due to thunderstorm and flight was lil shaky, and we all were very nervous and scared to death. but the way they handled the situation and made our journey worth and safe by taking care of it very nicely. Eventually our trust grew for the airline and their staff. Food was very yummy and upto the mark, (Veg and Non Veg both) we have also requested for child meal which was also good and as per the child's requirement, only my concern was for my baby who is 2 year old, for him i wanted food items like Idli, French fries or Medu wada so that kids of the similar age group kids can have it happily, since they served Pizza and Chole which my baby didn't eat, as he is not used to of eating such food like other kids and ended up having black forest pastry, which he loved the most. but overall our journey was very pleasant and satisfying with Vistara.

I would rather go on any other budget airline and sit on aisle seat for better comfort and may be in front rows.
The food was not very great.Spice jets choice seems far tempting even though it's chargeable.

A review of flying the new feeling,SamSridharan,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"I had originally booked myself on an evening flight on another airline but decided to take a morning #AirVistara flight instead. I took the decision one day prior to departure and found that the #AirVistara economy class pricing to be much lower than competition – about 15% lower approx. I made my booking on #Cleartrip of course – there is just no other site that is as well designed and intuitive. I put in my FF number on #Cleartrip while booking – usually the airline systems pick this up. The #AirVistara systems didn’t seem to, though.

Web-check in – I had to go to the #AirVistara site to do a seat assignment and check-in. The #AirVistara web-site is really slow and not built keeping the slowness of Indian internet in mind. Too many clunky images that take far too long to download. Once I was inside the web-checkin flow I felt that the flow was not intuitive. I had to first update the FF number – which is a separate funnel from the seat and meal selection. The seat selection is also not intuitive – there is a small box that logically looks like the place to click, but it is not. I was web checking-in about 14 hours prior and noticed that there were hardly any seats that were available – I counted less than a dozen. Is that because the airline system auto-allocates? I know from experience that so many people could not have checked in by themselves so much in advance. The exit row is not available for selection. This, for me, is a big negative as that is the seat that I select all the time and have no qualms about paying the extra charge for that comfort. After I finished checking-in I saw multiple options for delivery of the boarding pass (including an Apple Passbook feature) which I felt was well thought through. I couldn’t print the boarding pass as I didn’t have access to a printer and thought that I would do that at the airport kiosk.

Airport check-in – At the airport, I couldn’t see #AirVistara enabled in the kiosk. A big miss in my opinion, esp. if the core target audience is corporate & business travellers who have probably forgotten what it is like to stand in a check-in queue. At the check-in counter, I checked if the 11F that I had been allotted (thanks to someone in the #AirVistara team allotting this when we called them) was an exit row – and the agent was a bit confused, probably because of the LOPA changes currently underway (the airline is changing to a different seat configuration across their fleet). The service was, however, polite and courteous – definitely a few notches better that my recent experiences with other airlines.

Before the flight – The boarding process was smooth. Not sure if it was because there was no queue and I could walk straight through. The aircraft had a nice clean and fresh look to it and the welcome was warm and friendly. The exit row instructions were delivered personally rather than like a classroom that some airlines do these days. It was delivered well except that the attendant didn’t really make eye-contact all the time – doesn’t leave the right impression if the delivery is to be personal. Asked for some water before we took off and didn’t get it – maybe I was too close to push-back. Even if it was, would have been good to hear from the attendant that I would get it once we take off. I have never been a big fan of leather seats – feel that the leather makes the seat feel very hard, which is how the seats felt to me on the #AirVistara aircraft. The seats needed to be pushed very hard to get them to recline – not sure if that is the way they are designed or if it needs some looking into.

In the air – We pushed back ahead of time and were taxiing on the runway at the STD. That is something that one expects of a base departure anyways. There were only 7 exit row seats occupied which meant that I would have no one in the seat next to me – on a 2:30 long flight that was a luxury. This was in line with the occupancy in the Economy Cabin (I counted about 75 people) – which for a prime-time, week-day, inter-metro flight is a big commercial red flag. With extremely competitive pricing, why was it that #AirVistara was not able to fill the economy cabin? Is there a brand / marketing issue? Did they bank too much on last-minute demand that they forgot to get their share of the advance-booking travellers? Can’t really be an awareness issue as they have now been around for more than 15 months.

Food service – Carts were promptly rolled out as soon as we were airborne and I was served a veg breakfast as requested. My first impression was “Oh my god, the packaging is way too excessive”. Well designed for sure, but there must be other ways of delivering this that is far more ecologically responsible. The cutlery says “oxo-biodegradable pouch & cutlery – contributing to a sustainable planet’. Come on, we are just fooling ourselves if we seriously believe this. The poha and rava kesari/sheera for breakfast was really nice. A welcome change from the unexciting airline food that I have been having every week for the last several years.

The rest of the flight was quite uneventful as I decided to catch up on some sleep after I wrote this blog post. The landing was on time and quite smooth. There was an airport snafu when we got off the plane though – the gates to the terminal was shut and we had to wait for a few minutes before someone could open then.

Will I fly them again? I reckon so if their schedule is convenient for me – for which they will need to add more frequency on the routes that I usually fly every week.",Domestic,4.0,May 2016,27 May 2016,4.0,3.0,N/A,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
redefining the flying experience,Munish_Sharma,New Delhi - Hyderabad,"although they are no different from other airliners, but they definitely stand apart on their food front. after having terrible experience of food with other airliners, they serve good portions, and they are fresh, and taste pretty good. desserts are the best, especially chocolate mousse. plus they give you three options of seating, which you can pick according to your budget.",Domestic,5.0,June 2015,25 May 2016,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Flight Overbooked. Casual staff,GauravCh14,New Delhi - Ahmedabad,I was booked with confirmed ticket on Vistara flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad.

The supervisor Nikhil was too casual and seemed least bothered till I started video taping him. I asked him to provide for his manager's number which he denied saying can't provide and asked me to check the details online. This was my first time that I was trying a different flight than Indigo. Will never ever book Vistara. Just because you have Tata's name don't fleece customers. Over booking is your issue not mine. The same chap told me that you also work for hotels and overbook.

One of the best in flight services i have experienced in my more than 20 years of travelling,hmansari88,Ahmedabad - New Delhi,"I was travelling alone, returning from a business trip. The ticket was booked by my wife and as this happened to be the only flight meeting my time requirements-It was going to be Vistara (a tie up of TATA and Singapore Airlines).  I was expecting an uneventful flight and it was. The check-in staff were well spoken and well dressed as is the case with all airlines. (I might have generalized a bit about all airlines having well spoken staff.) Boarding was also carried out in sequential order of seating of course giving priority to women, children and elderly. Again now a days most airlines conduct their boarding in this manner so nothing new here. One thing which caught my attention was that in their announcements they referred to us (passengers) as ""customers"" which felt sort of depersonalized and distant. As I boarded the flight, it was obvious that they had acquired new planes-it felt clean and fresh. Found my seat and buckled up. After take off, they started the refreshment service. The food was good both in terms of quality and quantity. A lot of the passengers were fasting for navratra so they refused the food. The stewardesses could have cared less-they offered, the passengers refused-end of story. But this was not the case here. They kept asking them with a sound of genuine concern if they would like something else or if they would like to take something to eat later. This is what touched me most about this flight. Singapore airlines is known for their excellent service and hospitality and the staff at Vistara is doing a good job of upholding that tradition and this is why i believe it is one of the best domestic airlines I have flown till date. Their prices tend to be a bit on the pricier side and it would be nice if something could be done to make them more competetive so everyone would be able to get the Vistara experience and not just go for the other airline only because of the cheap air fare.
Its been more than a year since I have flown Vistara but my wife happened to travel with them recently and she assures me that they have maintained their hospitality even now.",Domestic,5.0,June 2015,4 May 2016,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The best airline in our country.,kanak2016,New Delhi - Guwahati,"When I saw that my husband had booked a Vistara flight for me I was curious. I hadn't heard of it before but soon found out that two big names, Tata and Singapore Airlines have come together to form Vistara. The word 'Vistaar' in Sanskrit means 'expanse'. Apt for an airline.
Vistara? A friendly face asks and guides me in Delhi airport even though I didn't need it. Inside, I think...hmm, that's nice! I asked for a window seat and got one. Early bird, I know but with the times I have had to travel sitting in the middle seat!! This was bliss! As soon my luggage is checked in I am guided towards the gate. Midway, another friendly face. Vistara? I'm liking this!
Once inside the aircraft, the difference is obvious. Friendly smiling stewards. Not the plastic smiles that do not reach the eyes with the perfunctory reluctant greeting before you reach your seat. Everyone is courteous. A welcome drink of coconut water arrives soon after we are seated. And after that wet towels were distributed. This airline cares!
Mine was a 2-hour-ten-minute flight. Midway between the flight meals were served.I'm including a picture of my non-vegetarian meal of 'Kheema pav"" along with one savoury accompaniment and dessert. It was good! I asked the lady who was seated next to me how hers went and she said she liked it. She had opted for a vegetarian meal. The air steward was very attentive and it was over all a very good experience flying this airline. I'd surely opt for Vistara the next time I travel.

Everything about Vistara is different from other airlines and the staff do take pains to ensure that it stays that way. I believe it is the fact that its a Tata enterprise.

The use of violet as a colour make you feel royal. the uniforms of the air hostesses are very well designed and suit and Indian context. The F&B menu boasts of dishes from around the country and items that I have generally not seen in other airlines or many restaurants.

First time - blown away,Adam R,Mumbai - Goa,"Having flown all the various airlines in India, thought it about time to try out the newest. On booking, noticed that premium economy was only a few pounds more than economy, and despite it being only an hours hop down to Goa, thought why not. Seamless check in, helpful staff offered me extra leg room (which i declined as wanted to see what standard leg room in premium economy is like). Boarded on time, all staff from ground to crew all immaculate and professional. Immaculate aircraft, spotlessly clean, nicely cooled, being in premium economy, extra few inches of legroom made all the difference. Cold towel and juice offered before take off, hot meal service during flight. Flight on time and the pilot greased the landing!! Faultless from start to finish. In general more expensive than the rest, but worth every penny!!!",Domestic,5.0,April 2016,17 April 2016,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Good flights with average service,Vishal_tulsi,Mumbai - Bagdogra,"We were a group of friends travelling from Mumbai to Bagdogra in the first week of March 2016. Vistara do not operate a direct flight from Mumbai to Bagdogra, we were booked Mumbai to New Delhi UK970 and then New Delhi to Bagdogra via Gauwahati UK765.

The best part about the check in with Vistara is that you get to see the Mumbai T2 Terminal. The overall check in procedure with Vistara is poor. We were asked to move from one counter to another for check in. May be this was due to we being a large group, but we have never faced any such situation before with any other airline operator.

The boarding procedure went on smoothly from Mumbai. However, the arrival gate at New Delhi and Departure Gate were really far from each other. This caused a great inconvenience to the group.

All the seats were booked with seats allotted togather at the time of booking. However, different seat allotted at the check in counter while issuing boarding passes causing the group to sit differently in flight from New Delhi to Bagdogra. We found it surprising that Mumbai New Delhi flight had proper seats allotted to us (same as booking) while New Delhi - Bagdogra had this issue. The cabin crew could not do much as the seat were allotted to other passengers.

The food served in flight was warm and good to eat. Even Jain food that was pre booked for 2 of our passengers was warm and good. The cabin crew was cheerful and helpful.

The landing and take off at all destinations were comfortable.

The Dark Horse!!,Shashwat877,New Delhi - Ahmedabad,"I am a frequent flier and have made innumerable trips last year. However, I got an opportunity to fly Vistara only this December.I don't remember any experience better than this for quite a long time. Since I travelled twice with them during their first anniversary celebrations, they offered me a premium economy ticket. Right from the quality of service to the menu, everything is aimed at delighting the customer. While everyone has been taking about Jet-Indigo-Spicejet, this airline has quietly made its foray and went onto provide A class service to its guests without much ado. I just hope that they expand to every sector possible and keep up the good work",Domestic,5.0,December 2015,15 February 2016,4.0,4.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

One airline whose first priority is the guest!,Nihal Kumar,New Delhi - Lucknow,"We were travelling to Lucknow and were carrying heavy luggage. Reached the airport very late due to a massive traffic jam at the Delhi Gurgaon border. Initially, the airline staff refused to allow us boarding, but then they relented and let us check in. Special word for Ms. Aanchal, who was very helpful. The airline staff ran with us carrying our cabin luggage, right upto Gate 52 (IGI T3) and ensured that we managed to board the flight. The interiors of the aircraft were clean, seats looked royal, stewards were courteous, and food was good too. We were pleasantly surprised when we collected our luggage at Lucknow as it was marked fragile and eventually loaded in the aircraft at Delhi. Absolutely loved the experience of flying Vistara, and also the airline which gives so much attention to their guests. Thank you Vistara!",Domestic,5.0,November 2015,3 February 2016,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
wonderful airline,occlusion_vikas,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"a brand new airline , cabin crew and a simply great new experience ! sadly for the stupid ground staff of SATS who are far below the international standards . i guess tata and singapore airlines should take a call on this issue.",Domestic,5.0,December 2015,1 February 2016,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
"A true test passed with flying colours, Love the new feeling",Ashutosh Raina,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"It was my first on Air Vistara, A true new feeling retaining the trust of Tata and the Experience of Singapore Airlines. Highly professional, courteous and swift service with a smile. They know their job well and the way to do it. 

Though my 6 am flight was delayed for almost 6 hrs due to fog departing at 12 but the efficient management and skilled staff never let me feel the crunch. They were well Informed and updated us regularly along with timely meals at 6:30 at the food court then on board at 9 then in the air with some snacks. 

Cabin has a fresh interior with all leather seats, adjustable Headrests, enough legroom even in the last row with reclining seats.

The pilot covered the distance in a short time and landed smooth, a very rare experience from a domestic flyer in India.

I look forward towards new flights and hope the feeling stays new forever.

Great new airline,Pooja0711,Ahmedabad - New Delhi,A great no nonsense airline. Very professional staff. They serve decent food (no need to purchase).

Best airlines in the domestic sector but they need to increase their fleet.,bhargavakhil,Hyderabad - New Delhi,I have used Vitara for the first time after its launch this year. It has been an amazing experience flying with them since the air staff makes sure you have a comfortable journey and provide you with hot towels during the landing and take off which ensures that you look fresh by the time you get off the flight. The food provided by them were upto the International Airlines standards.

Trendy full service airline,Prabhjot S,Lucknow - New Delhi,"A trendy full service airline is how I would describe this airline. Being a Singapore Airlines joint venture with TATA, you could only expect a classy service and its bang on. Right from the way they treat customers to the actual experience of flying with them, the airline was by far a very good experience. The food, especially, was very good in quality and in line with what one would expect from airlines when flying in the 1980s-1990s. The general aura of the plane and the smartly dressed air hostesses can only be described as trendy. Leg room was adequate, seats were comfortable, air hostesses and staff were courteous, price was right for the service offered. There was no in-flight entertainment probably due to the short flight time (<1 hour).",Domestic,4.0,January 2016,29 January 2016,5.0,5.0,N/A,4.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
Airline to watch out for!,voyageur1806,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Air Vistara is a true hallmark of the Tata and Singapore airlines brand. It has totally disrupted the Indian airline sector and offers extra value for money at competitive prices, good quality food, service and planes. I cannot comment on the timeliness of the airlines as the flights to and from Delhi are delayed in the winters due to heavy fog conditions. Also, the fact that it takes the international terminals in both Delhi and Mumbai, just add to the overall experience of the journey!",Domestic,5.0,January 2016,27 January 2016,3.0,4.0,N/A,4.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
