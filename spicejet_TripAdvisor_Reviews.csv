"At Spice Jet, the military term shines brightly - SNAFU: situation normal: all f**ked up.",Tong S,New Delhi - Belgaum,"SNAFU with Spice Jet:

At Spice Jet, the military term shines brightly - SNAFU: situation normal: all f**ked up.

Ticket was booked Jan 14th, later a boarding pass generated on their website.
On the day of flight 2/4, airline staff said that you canceled your check-in on 1/28?
I was forced to be bumped to the next flight by them doing me a favor as the one canceled my own flight though they issued a boarding pass to me already.
When I asked how that would be even possible, they flash a screen saying that a cancellation was made in 1:28, so their system records me as “ni Show”. That’s a week before this flight which is a short 1.5 hours flight.  A No Show for a flight a week later in order to sell my ticket.
I took a photo of their screen as what they were flashing me with made no sense.  I was sternly asked to delete the photo by multiple people at the gate.

What really happened: 
The flight was getting full near the end of January, they raised the price significantly, and canceled some tickets.  But there is notification and any compensation, just a fall blame on a full paying and diligent customer with ticket and boarding pass in hand.

There are several standing by holding more expensive tickets behind me who all got on the flights.  And more than 1 person confirmed that it is a full flight.

If there was any doubt about their scheme, what happened next eliminated all suspicion that it is an error, or negligence. It was deliberate.  They offered me another flight 7 hours later.  I had to accept it in order to travel. And the replacement ticket is already made!  There was a person on the phone with the boarding gate desk throughout the whole process. The moment they offered and I accepted a forced delay, the “ticket” in the form of a screenshot on the gate attendance’s mobile phone appeared.  They have all along prepared this option after their decision to over book and keep higher prices purchases and bump people off without refund or any perks or compensation.  I’d rather they are honest to ask me to pay extra and save the 7 hours wait; not to mention all the changes I have to make for the day.  Their attitudes and blaming on customers they deliberately cheated made the whole fiasco even more difficult.

SpiceJet – The Absolute Worst Airline! Stay Away!,Priyanka S,New Delhi - Pune,"SpiceJet – The Absolute Worst Airline! Stay Away!

If I could give negative stars, I would. SpiceJet is by far the most pathetic excuse for an airline I have ever encountered. Their Delhi airport staff, especially the so-called “manager,” is unbelievably rude, uncooperative, and full of arrogance, acting like they’re paying us to fly instead of the other way around.

First, they randomly canceled my flight with some ridiculous excuse, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. To make matters worse, they didn’t even refund my money! No proper explanation, no customer support—just a blatant scam to rob passengers of their hard-earned money.

And if that wasn’t enough, when I finally booked another flight, I arrived just two minutes late for luggage check-in (with still a full hour before takeoff!), yet they flat-out refused to let me board. No empathy, no professionalism—just a bunch of rude staff enjoying making passengers suffer.

Intimidation and Harassment by SpiceJet Ground Staff,Odyssey07374670119,Bengaluru - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I had an extremely distressing experience with SpiceJet during the boarding process for my flight (PNR: HBB72M). One of their ground staff members, who identified himself as Mr. Vinay, subjected me to unwarranted harassment, intimidation, and threats, despite my willingness to comply and pay the required baggage charges.

Here’s a summary of what I endured:

Weight Discrepancy and Lack of Proof: My hand luggage was 6 kg over the limit, as I observed on the scale. However, Mr. Vinay insisted it was 7 kg without providing any proof. When I questioned this, he rudely dismissed me and told me to “talk to SpiceJet later” because “his decision was final.”

Dismissal of Reasonable Solutions: I offered to check in one of my bags to adhere to the baggage rules, but Mr. Vinay refused and stated it was “not his responsibility.”

Threats of Denied Boarding: Despite my cooperation and readiness to pay, Mr. Vinay repeatedly threatened, “I will not allow you to board the flight,” as if he was doing me a favor by even engaging in the conversation.

Hostile and Intimidating Language: At one point, Mr. Vinay warned me that I would be reported to the DGCA and would receive calls from security upon landing. He even claimed he could ban me from flying with SpiceJet in the future.

Unnecessary Escalation: After issuing a receipt for the additional baggage charges, he refused my request to document the excess weight on the receipt. When I requested to read the receipt before signing, he threatened me again with “You don’t have to board the flight then.”

Inconsistent Payment Options: Initially, he demanded payment via card only, despite my readiness to pay through UPI. This lack of flexibility further added to the frustration.

This entire experience felt like an orchestrated attempt to humiliate and intimidate me. The staff member used aggressive and condescending language, turning a routine process into a nightmare.

Key Questions for SpiceJet:

Why was I, a cooperative passenger, subjected to such degrading treatment?
What breach of security did I allegedly commit to warrant threats of DGCA involvement and security scrutiny?
Why did the staff refuse to provide proof of the claimed excess weight and dismiss my suggestions for resolution?
This level of unprofessionalism is shocking.

Eventually, the steward brought one from inside, but the air hostess gave unpleasant expressions and commented, “Oh, you got the spoon from our meals,” which felt unnecessarily rude and unprofessional.

Worst Experience of my lIfe,Trek22378360305,Dubai - Amritsar,"I recently traveled with this airline and had a terrible experience from start to finish. The flight was delayed by 2 hours, and after finally boarding, passengers were made to wait for an additional hour inside the plane. The boarding process was chaotic and disorganized, making the entire situation frustrating from the very beginning.

Once on the plane, the seats were uncomfortable, and the cleanliness was appalling. It was clear that the cabin had not been properly cleaned prior to boarding.

To make matters worse, after landing, my luggage was missing. The airline staff informed us that it had been left behind, but they couldn't provide any clear timeline for when it would be returned. When I asked for more details, the staff was unhelpful and vague, giving me a range of ""maybe"" dates with no firm commitment.

The staff's attitude was the most concerning. They were rude and dismissive when I inquired about the delay and the missing luggage. One staff member even told me, ""I can see the weather, don't disturb us."" It felt as though the staff had no regard for passengers' concerns and were simply going through the motions without any genuine care for the guests.

Unprofessional  and Unethical Airline,asabuwala,Dubai - Mumbai,"Mishandling of Checked Baggage by SpiceJet

On January 6, I travelled from Dubai to Mumbai on a SpiceJet flight, with an onward connection to Udaipur (via Indigo Airlines)  later the same day after a layover of seven hours. I checked in my baggage at Dubai Airport well before the mandatory two-hour deadline.  Upon arrival, my checked baggage did not arrive at Mumbai Airport.

I approached a SpiceJet staff member, who informed me that my bag had been left behind in Dubai. They assured me it would be sent on the next flight scheduled for the evening of January 6. Based on their recommendation, I rescheduled my onward flight to Udaipur for the following day, January 7, incurring additional charges of Rs 4960 that they promised could be reimbursed. Unfortunately, the baggage did not arrive on the subsequent flight either, and I had to proceed to Udaipur without it.

What followed was a distressing experience involving repeated attempts to trace my baggage. Over the next four days, I made approximately 20 to 25 calls to SpiceJet’s helpdesk, which appeared completely uninformed about the status of my luggage. Eventually, my bag was located in Calicut, Kerala. Despite my request to have it delivered to Mumbai, the airline inexplicably sent the bag back to Dubai. After further delays and persistent follow-ups, my baggage was finally delivered to Mumbai five days after my arrival.

This experience was deeply disappointing due to the airline’s lack of professionalism, poor communication, and inability to handle the situation efficiently. SpiceJet’s service throughout this ordeal was unacceptable, and I strongly advise against choosing this airline for travel.

Baggage got opened and valuable are missing,Vikas Bhandari,Mumbai - Dubai,"This is to bring you into notice that I had planned to go on a vacation in December. I have taken the SG-59 Flight which is from BOM to DXB. We have done the baggage check-in. We have onboarded the flight. 
While collecting the Baggage from Belt number 3 in DXB. We collected and added in the trolley. 

But when we reached the hotel and at that time, when I was trying to open one of the suitcases. I saw that the 3-digit code for that luggage was reset to 0-0-0. Then Immediately I took videos and photos of the luggage. Because the lock which I have set in Mumbai was different. 

 I am extremely disappointed with the handling of my baggage. Upon arrival, I discovered that my luggage had been opened and tampered with. This is not only unacceptable but also highly concerning for the safety and security of passengers’ belongings.

I saw that the complete luggage was checked by some member in the airport(Baggage Team). It was opened by someone, he has checked each and every cloth and some valuable item is missing from the bag. I have raised the complaint on custrelations@spicejet.com. It's been 13 days I have not got the revert yet. My concern is how come the ground staff who is carrying the luggage from check-in to flight can open the bag in the middle while carrying it. If they are having any concerns any issues, then can inform the passenger and then they can open the luggage bag in their presence.

I am looking for help, where SpiceJet can catch the ground staff who is involved in it. Also, I am looking for my valuable item to get them back. I have requested team to check all the camera's at all the Gate which are present.I had a very bad experience with the airline.

Our Unforgettable (FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS) Experience with SpiceJet,Shalini C,Port Blair - New Delhi,"Ah, SpiceJet. Where to even begin? We had the misfortune of booking our tickets to Port Blair from Delhi via Chennai with this airline. Let’s just say it turned out to be one of the worst flying experiences of our lives—and we’ve flown budget before, so that’s saying something.

Act I: The Delayed Departure
We left Port Blair on January 3rd, an hour and a half behind schedule because the flight’s arrival was delayed. Annoying, but manageable. Instead of landing in Delhi at the promised 11 PM, we found ourselves in Delhi’s airspace sometime after midnight. Then came the announcement: due to heavy fog in Delhi, the flight would be diverted to Jaipur. Most passengers, including us, understood this—it’s weather; what can you do?

But what followed was a masterclass in how to not handle a situation.

Act II: Chaos in Jaipur
• After landing in Jaipur, we stayed on the tarmac for an unnecessarily long time. Just to keep things exciting, of course.

• Then came Announcement #1: “Please collect your luggage and disembark.” Dutifully, everyone stood up, gathered their cabin baggage, and prepared to exit. But wait! Announcement #2 swooped in moments later, telling us to sit down again—with no explanation whatsoever.

• And then… radio silence. For two whole hours. NEITHER THE CAPTAIN NOR THE CABIN CREW OR GROUND STAFF FELT IT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A SINGLE UPDATE. The ground staff? Nowhere to be found. Maybe they were on vacation.

Act III: A Comedy of Errors (If It Weren’t So Infuriating)
• My nephew, feeling sick before landing in Jaipur, was met with a delightful surprise: no airsick bags in the seat pockets. None. Anywhere. WHAT KIND OF AIRLINE SKIMPS ON AIRSICK BAGS?

• After two hours of passengers silently fuming, some brave souls finally started asking questions. Only then did the ground staff emerge like mythical creatures from a long-forgotten legend.

• The cherry on top? The crew began refueling the aircraft, which would have been fine if they didn’t subject us to a series of cringe-worthy, subpar announcements about it.

Finally, after three long hours, we were informed that the flight was canceled because—wait for it—the cabin crew had exceeded their duty hours. They had three hours to figure this out, but apparently, basic math isn’t a SpiceJet strength.

Act IV: A Medical Emergency and the Final Insult
• After disembarking, my sick nephew had a seizure on the cold tarmac and had to be attended to right there. And what was SpiceJet’s staff doing during this distressing scene? Standing around like spectators at a sports game. I have pictures to prove their utter uselessness.

• Despite having three hours to prepare, the airline had not even managed to set up a helpdesk for stranded passengers. Brilliant planning, truly.

By the time we collected our luggage and left the airport, we’d given up expecting any semblance of help or responsibility from this airline.

To SpiceJet Management and Ground Staff:
SHAME ON YOU, SPICEJET!!!
You’ve set a new standard for how not to treat your customers. Your complete lack of professionalism, compassion, and basic competence is nothing short of shameful.

Terrible Experience with SpiceJet Flight Management and Cabin Crew,taha s,Dubai - Mumbai,"I am writing this review to express my utter disappointment with SpiceJet's abysmal level of service, which has left me frustrated and deeply dissatisfied.

Incident Overview:

Upon boarding the flight, I discovered that the check-in gates were closed 30 minutes before departure, leaving passengers scrambling to make it on time without clear instructions or assistance from the ground staff.
To make matters worse, when I landed at my destination, my baggage did not arrive on the conveyor belt.
Follow-Up Nightmare:

I followed up multiple times with SpiceJet's management and customer service regarding the missing baggage. I was informed that my baggage would arrive on the next flight to Mumbai at 10 PM on January 6th.
However, after waiting beyond 10 PM, the baggage still didn’t arrive. Upon contacting customer service yet again, the response I received was nothing short of shocking:
""We don’t really know much about it.""

Eventually, I was informed that my baggage was declared lost, leaving me stranded without my belongings and without the airline's accountability.
Unacceptable Service:
This level of negligence is beyond disgraceful for an airline that claims to serve passengers professionally. It is unacceptable that:

The baggage was not loaded onto the flight, reflecting the cabin crew's and ground staff's complete failure.
The customer service team provided conflicting and unhelpful information, adding to the frustration.
No compensation or proper resolution was offered for the lost baggage, leaving me to bear the financial and emotional burden.
Call for Action:
Stringent action must be taken against the flight management and cabin crew responsible for this mishandling. It is unacceptable for passengers to endure such incompetence and lack of accountability. This experience has severely eroded my trust in SpiceJet, and I will actively discourage others from using this airline unless significant improvements are made.

Conclusion:
SpiceJet's service was terrible, disgraceful, and indicative of a broader failure in customer care and operational efficiency. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and appropriate compensation for my ordeal. Passengers deserve much better than this appalling level of service. I shall be taking Strict action against the flight management for this disgraceful experience; I highly urge people to avoid travelling on this substandard low-cost airline with such an unacceptable level of customer service. Instead, I would recommend alternative airlines to travel

The worst airline to exit with horrible customer care service,Nomad46568346320,Kochi - Chennai (Madras),"I had initially booked a SpiceJet flight from Kochi to Chennai on January 4th, 2024, with a departure time of 9:20 PM. However, the airline later rescheduled the flight multiple times—to 10:35 PM and then again to 11:20 PM, which pushed the arrival time in Chennai to 12:40 AM. This was highly inconvenient for me, as traveling alone and arranging transportation at such a late hour would be challenging. Given that the rescheduling exceeded two hours, I was entitled to reschedule my flight, which I chose to do for January 5th, 2024, on their 8:40 AM flight.

On the morning of January 5th, as I prepared for my journey, I was shocked to learn that this flight had been canceled and rescheduled for January 7th, 2024—an unacceptable delay of two days. This change caused extreme inconvenience, as I had commitments scheduled for January 6th, 2024, that I could not miss. I had paid a significant amount for this booking and did not anticipate this level of disruption.

When I contacted SpiceJet’s customer care to inquire about the cancellation, I was initially told that it was due to weather conditions. However, other airlines operating on the same route were unaffected. Later, I was informed it was a scheduling error, raising questions about the airline’s transparency and operational competence. I was given only two options: reschedule the flight for January 7th or cancel my booking altogether. Given my commitments, I was forced to opt for cancellation.

Adding to my frustration, upon checking the booking app later, I discovered there was a SpiceJet flight departing on January 5th at 9:20 PM, with available seats. Despite this, I was never offered the option to fly on that flight, which was not only unfair but also indicated a serious lapse in customer care. When I brought this to the attention of SpiceJet’s customer care, I was informed that the cancellation could not be reversed, essentially blaming me for the decision, despite their failure to provide me with all possible options in the first place.

The customer service experience was appalling. The wait times were excessively long, and my request to speak to a senior staff member was repeatedly denied. I was told that seniors would only be available at 12 PM, forcing me to call back later. Even when I did, I had to repeat my entire ordeal to another representative, only to be denied access to a senior once more. I was eventually promised a callback at 1:30 PM, but this entire ordeal demonstrated a complete lack of professionalism and accountability on the part of SpiceJet’s customer service team.

This experience raises serious concerns about the airline’s commitment to customer satisfaction and its operational integrity. It almost feels like a deliberate ploy to inconvenience passengers, potentially pushing them toward cancellations and higher-priced rebookings—an exploitative practice that borders on a scam. The lack of transparency, the unwillingness to provide reasonable solutions, and the irresponsible behavior of senior staff at the customer care center all point to systemic failures in the company’s operations.

When a senior staff member, Mr. Mohan Kumar, finally contacted me, I pointed out the apparent exploitation of passengers through cancellations and the lack of proper alternatives, which seemed to compel customers to purchase higher-priced tickets. His response was shockingly dismissive and rude: “You probably shouldn’t fly our airline if you can’t afford it.” Another senior employee, Ms. Neha Bharadwaj, displayed similarly unprofessional behavior, further compounding my dissatisfaction with the airline’s customer service standards
As a consumer, I demand compensation for the inconvenience caused, the stress of managing alternative arrangements, and the lack of proper resolution to my concerns.

Despite the urgency of the situation, the staff at Chennai, including the Duty Supervisor and staffs, were unhelpful and dismissive, leaving me stranded and without support.

This forced me to purchase an alternate ticket from another airline at five times the original cost, resulting in significant financial loss and stress. Adding to the frustration, SpiceJet has refused to refund my ticket at least  which is both unethical and unfair to passengers.

Such behavior reflects poor customer service and disregard for passenger rights.

Worst Experience Ever!,Abinash S,Srinagar - Bengaluru,"Worst Experience Ever!

My recent SpiceJet flight from Srinagar to Bangalore was a nightmare. The flight was delayed by over 3 hours and 40 minutes, with no refreshments provided. 

After finally departing, the layover flight (Delhi) to Bangalore had a non-functioning cooling system for over an hour, making it extremely uncomfortable for passengers.

Despite repeated requests, the only response from the crew was to ""be patient."" This is completely unacceptable service, especially considering the price of airfare.

I will be filing a formal complaint with SpiceJet and strongly advise others to consider alternative airlines. This experience has definitely discouraged me from ever flying with SpiceJet again.

Carry on 🧳 including laptop bag should be 7 kg, how can an Indian airline make its own rules ? Rather following international standards 

They charged 140 aed to all the pasangers for access carry on. How ever they do not weight carry on at the time of giving boarding pass

Extremely Disappointing Experience with SpiceJet after Flight Cancellation Flight Cancelled,Pankaj,New Delhi - Khajuraho,"Extremely Disappointing Experience with SpiceJet

I was scheduled to fly on flight SG231 from Delhi to Khajuraho on October 26, 2024, but the flight was canceled more than two hours after the scheduled departure time. To make matters worse, no refreshments were provided during the long wait at the airport. Although the staff promised compensation, I have yet to receive any follow-up. I have sent multiple emails to SpiceJet’s Customer Relations team and escalated the matter to the Appellate Authority, but they continue to manipulate the situation and give contradictory responses regarding the flight cancellation.

There were over 80 passengers booked on the same flight, all of whom can attest to the fact that the flight was indeed canceled. Despite this, SpiceJet has failed to offer any meaningful support or resolution.

I am still waiting for my refund, which has been pending for 25 days now. As of today, November 20, 2024, I am thoroughly disappointed and frustrated by this experience. SpiceJet has been the worst airline experience I’ve ever had, and I would strongly advise others to reconsider flying with them.",Domestic,1.0,October 2024,20 November 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

To make matters worse, instead of offering another direct flight, they gave us a frustrating itinerary with multiple connecting flights, which kept getting delayed at every step:

Ahmedabad to Goa, originally scheduled for 5:55 AM, was delayed to 7:05 AM.
Goa to Pune, originally scheduled for 1:55 PM, was delayed to 2:55 PM and then further to 4:20 PM.

Harrowing experience with Spicejet airlines,Trip55699791946,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Complaint Regarding SpiceJet Flights SG 8521 and SG 8174

On October 17, 2024, my wife and I embarked on what we hoped would be a seamless journey from New Delhi to Kolkata aboard SpiceJet flight SG 8521. Unfortunately, our experience was anything but smooth.

Initially directed to Gate 42C, we, as senior citizens, painstakingly made our way there, only to find ourselves waiting indefinitely. Despite our vigilant observation of the flight information screens, our flight number was conspicuously absent. To our dismay, announcements for flights scheduled after ours began to appear, heightening our anxiety.

In a state of growing concern, we desperately sought out SpiceJet personnel or a service booth to clarify the situation. However, there was no representative in sight, and even the police personnel were unable to assist. Attempts to reach SpiceJet via their helpline proved futile as the number was non-functional.

Salvation came in the unlikely form of an airline cleaner, who advised us to proceed to Gate 55, where we might find a SpiceJet official. Exhausted, we ascended the stairs to the second floor, only to be informed by the official that the incoming flight from Pune had not yet arrived, and we were asked to wait.

Our ordeal continued as we were shuttled from one distant gate to another. Breathless and weary, we finally tried to rest, only to be redirected yet again, this time to Gate 52. The sheer inefficiency and lack of coordination displayed by SpiceJet were appalling.

This incident is not an isolated one; delayed flights seem to be a chronic issue with SpiceJet, as we and our family members have experienced similar predicaments before. For instance, on August 18, 2024, my wife endured another harrowing experience with SpiceJet flight SG 8174 ( PNR: ZIYIXN)  from Kolkata (Terminal 2) to Delhi (Terminal 3). The flight, originally scheduled to depart at 17:40 and arrive at 20:05, was delayed to 22:00 and finally landed at 23:50. Such significant delays are unacceptable and indicative of systemic issues within the airline.

It appears that the airline is plagued by financial constraints, leading to a reduced fleet that is overburdened with frequent trips, resulting in persistent delays. These financial woes also manifest in the form of minimal service counters and inadequately trained staff, culminating in subpar service. Even the baggage claim process is affected, with shared counters causing further delays in luggage retrieval.

In light of these harrowing experiences, I strongly advise against travelling with SpiceJet. The airline's dismal service and operational inefficiencies make it a choice best avoided.

Horrendous experience with 2 consecutive flight cancellations delaying our departure by 2 days,Roam65119365180,Chennai (Madras) - Mysuru (Mysore),"Absolutely horrendous experience, it was a nightmare. We went all the way to airport, got luggage checked in and got the boarding passes. After all that they tell us the flight is delayed by more than an hour due to a ""technical problem"" and that they don't have permission to take off after 5:30, so the flight will be cancelled and we cannot go.

Reluctantly we rescheduled to the next day flight at the same time, and surprise surprise, they call us back a few hours before departure time and tell us flight is delayed today also and will not take off mostly. They are also trying to convince us to cancel our tickets so they can present it as though we are the ones who willingly cancelled.

The basic question is why schedule a flight for take off just 1 hour before the cutoff time for when you are allowed to take off at the airport ?

Will never travel in this airline again, the amount of problems they have caused for us and the time wasted I can never do justice to.

The second problem is much more serious. After malfunctions with their website caused a duplicate booking and charge on my credit card 11 days ago, SpiceJet has made it virtually impossible for me to receive a refund-- I have spent hours on the phone and been promised its prompt processing multiple times.

Bad Customer Service Experience,Pioneer57056410727,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Port Blair,"On October 5, 2024, my parents and family members were supposed to board the fight SG 869 (PNR: KG26VQ) from Kolkata to Port Blair. The flight was scheduled from 7:25 - 9:30 am. Boarding time was 6:55 am. 

They reached the airport late due to heavy traffic on the road. When they checked in at 7:15 am, they were told that the flight had already reached the runway and couldn’t be informed of their arrival. The flight departed without them, leading to wastage of their tickets. 

While I understand the delay from their side (which was caused by the harrowing traffic), airlines have the practice of getting in touch with customers if they are getting delayed. I am a frequent flyer and I have experienced multiple cases when either the ground staff has given me a call asking for my arrival status or even the flights waiting for a few minutes (5-10) to accommodate customers who have gotten delayed. 

In this case, not only were they not contacted before with flight left for the runway without them, the ground staff told them that they could not contact the flight in any way when they reached the airport at 7:15 am. I would like to reiterate here that the flight was scheduled to departure at 7:25 am, so even though they were late for boarding, they were at the airport near the boarding gate BEFORE the departure time. Yet the flight left without four of its customers, without any intimation from the ground staff. 

This is a high degree of unprofessionalism displayed by SpiceJet team. My parents or other family members could have been called and contacted before the flight left for the runway. The team should have made efforts to know their arrival status and been in touch with them. This is a standard practice among airline customer services which was completely avoided in this case.

Our flight, originally scheduled to depart at 10:45 PM, was delayed multiple times without any clear communication. First, we were told it would take off at 1:45 AM on September 1st. As frustrating as that was, nothing could prepare us for the next delay: 7:30 AM.

However, the most distressing part of this experience was the lack of support from SpiceJet’s ground staff. Instead of offering genuine help, we were given absurd options like taking a different flight from Dubai to Pune, or worse, canceling our current flight and booking a new one with another airline at our own expense. This left us and other passengers feeling abandoned and helpless, with no alternative but to wait for hours on end.

To add insult to injury, SpiceJet informed us that any refund for our disrupted flight would take up to 30 days. The audacity of this airline is beyond comprehension, expecting us to wait an entire month to get back what is rightfully ours after such a horrendous experience.

It was also shocking to hear from fellow passengers that this isn’t an isolated incident. Apparently, this has been happening for quite some time. SpiceJet’s recurring delays, poor communication, and lack of customer support have become the norm. We were left feeling powerless, stranded in a foreign country with no real help or concern from the airline that we trusted with our travel plans.

This experience was not just a minor inconvenience—it was a complete disruption of our lives and plans. I urge anyone considering SpiceJet to think twice before booking. No one should have to go through what we did, and no airline should be allowed to treat its passengers with such blatant disregard. This is a plea to all travelers: be warned, and don’t let SpiceJet ruin your journey as they did ours.

This summary captures the frustration and disappointment with SpiceJet and serves as a warning for others. You can share this on social media, review platforms, or directly with the airline’s customer service team.",International,1.0,August 2024,31 August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Worst Behavior, Poor Service Experience",Navigator60964927539,Mumbai - Dubai,"Feedback on Poor Service Experience - SpiceJet Flight SG-59 on 22nd August 2024
Dear 
SpiceJet Sr Management Team & Customer Service,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received from both your airport staff and call center team in relation to my flight SG-59 from Bombay to Dubai, scheduled for 2:00 AM on 22nd August 2024.

Details of the Experience:

I arrived at Terminal 2 of the airport at 10:15 PM on 21st August 2024.

Airport Experience:

Upon inquiring about SpiceJet’s office at Terminal 2, I was informed by the security that your customer service and booking office are located at Terminal 1. Upon reaching Terminal 1, I approached the help desk where two employees, a male and a female, were present. The female employee contacted the duty manager, Ms. More, who informed me that they couldn’t assist with postponing my flight and advised me to contact the call center instead.

Call Center Experience:

I called the call center at 11:40 PM and had to wait for an hour before my call was finally answered by Mr. Ansu, who informed me that he could not assist and that I needed to email higher management. Additionally, I received an SMS notifying me that my flight was delayed by 2 hours. I called the call center again at 12:15 AM, and after another half-hour wait, my call was answered by Ms. Kushi, who stated that any changes to my booking should have been made 4 hours prior.

Concerns:

1. Inadequate Customer Service:

The staff at the airport were not helpful in addressing my concerns or providing a solution. I expected better on-ground assistance from SpiceJet.

2. Call Center Delays:

 The extensive wait times on both calls were unacceptable, and the responses provided by your call center representatives were unhelpful and dismissive.

3. Lack of Clear Communication:

There was no clear guidance on how to handle my situation, and I was left without any viable options.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience, and I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter. It would be helpful to understand why there was such a lack of support from your team and what steps will be taken to prevent this from happening in the future.

I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

"SpiceJet Flight SG 59 from Mumbai to Dubai Delayed, Passengers Frustrated Over Lack of Support",Thomas Mendes,Mumbai - Dubai,"Mumbai, August 14, 2024 – Passengers on SpiceJet Flight SG 59, scheduled to depart from Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport to Dubai International Airport, faced significant delays and mounting frustration this morning as the flight was unexpectedly rescheduled from 2:00 AM to 8:00 AM (6 Hours Delay).

The delay, which left passengers stranded at the airport, has been met with widespread dissatisfaction, particularly due to the unhelpful attitude of the airline staff and the absence of any compensation or amenities. Many travelers, including those with connecting flights in Dubai, expressed their anger and disappointment at the lack of support and information provided by SpiceJet.

“We’ve been waiting here for hours with no clear communication from the airline,” said one passenger. “There’s no help, no food, no accommodations—nothing. It’s unacceptable.”

Another passenger, who had an interconnecting flight from Dubai, voiced concern over the lack of compensation. “According to the law, we should be entitled to a refund or some form of compensation for this mess. Instead, we’re left to fend for ourselves.”

The situation at the airport has grown increasingly tense as more passengers express their frustration over the poor service. Many are calling for immediate action and accountability from SpiceJet to address the inconvenience caused by the delay.

As of now, SpiceJet has not issued an official statement regarding the delay or the passengers’ concerns.",International,2.0,July 2024,13 August 2024,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0
SpiceJet never again,Chaitanya T,Pune - Jaipur,"Our experience with SpiceJet yday was the worst we have ever had with any business in the last 40 plus years of my life.
The flight faced some technical problem and had to brought back from runway. This is not the real issue. The real issue started after that. The airlines team had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the pessengers.
They did not communicate as to what options the pessengers have until the pessengers lost their cool. Which means the pessengers were kept hanging for more than  5 hours from 8 pm till 1 am.
The airlines staff was not ready to communicate the bad news that flight is cancelled for the day. Neither they had any plans of providing any alternatives to the pessengers. Pessengers had to keep asking the same questions and there was one junior staff member to handle a crowd of more than 50 pessengers.  She was trying to pacify without any logic or any real data and was obviously not knowing what to do and pessengers were also losing their patience. Finally after 1  am they said  that this flight is now revised to fly next day same time under a different flight number. The original flight of next day was cancelled. And this new flight was planned by SpiceJet. But an next day same story repeats the flight scheduled for 7.45pm is already delayed by 2 hours. And there is no guarantee that it will even go ahead based on previous days experience. One final word. Do not travel by this airline.

The horror didn't end there. Upon landing, we were subjected to yet another agonizing wait—this time for our luggage.

Disappointing Experience with SpiceJet: Unreliable Service and Poor Customer Support,SabyaSachi Dey,Mumbai - New Delhi,"I recently had a rather unpleasant experience with SpiceJet that I feel compelled to share. I booked a flight with SpiceJet through the Amazon app on August 10th for a departure time of 11:10 PM. However, shortly after making the booking, I received a notification informing me that my flight had been rescheduled to 12:45 AM. This change was inconvenient but manageable.

Upon arriving at the airport and checking in for my flight, I was shocked to receive yet another message stating that the flight had been further delayed to 2:45 AM. This sudden rescheduling caused significant disruption to my travel plans and inconvenienced me greatly.

Frustrated and disappointed by the lack of reliability in SpiceJet's scheduling, I approached the airline staff to request a refund. To my dismay, not only did I encounter uncooperative staff, but I was also appalled by their unprofessional behavior and their use of inappropriate language. The way I was treated by both the airline and their support team was entirely unacceptable.

As a customer who values punctuality, reliability, and respectful customer service, my experience with SpiceJet fell far short of my expectations. The repeated rescheduling of my flight, coupled with the disrespectful behavior of the airline's staff, has left me deeply dissatisfied with my overall experience.

I urge SpiceJet to take customer feedback seriously, address issues of flight scheduling reliability, and ensure that their staff maintain a professional and respectful demeanor when interacting with customers. Until such improvements are made, I regret to say that I cannot recommend SpiceJet as a reliable or customer-friendly airline choice.

I hope my feedback serves as a constructive criticism for SpiceJet to enhance their services and customer relations in the future.",Domestic,1.0,August 2024,10 August 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"Unprofessional higher management, poor hygiene",Sunshine14954802117,New Delhi - Srinagar,"The airlines is lingering on the verge of extinction. They reschedule the flight timings at their whims and fancy. My 16.45 flight on 9th August 2024 got rescheduled to 11.10 AM and all I received was a notification email ignoring the fact that the customer choose the fight timings as per their convenience and schedule and still left on the mercy of unprofessional airline's management who give no hoot that how much inconvenience it causes by rescheduling the flight timings.

My ordeal didn't end here. I booked a flight for next day 9.05 Am but even that got delayed by 1 hour and I am still sitting in the flight without any knowledge about how much time they may take to be in the sky.

The moment I entered the aircraft I encountered the foul smell that took me back to roadway buses in tier 2 cities.

I am worried about the hard work of the cabin crew and other ground staff that suffer and bear the brunt of  the  passenger's due to the unprofessional management by top level Executives taking fat pay checks and sitting complacent while the as an organisation it's failing.

We were traveling with children from the US and had just stopped in Dubai before heading to a family event in Madurai. At the time, SpiceJet was the only airline offering flights from Dubai to Madurai, so we had no choice but to fly with them.

When we finally arrived at the airport after our additional day in Dubai, the service was dismal. The counter staff were unprofessional and indifferent to the long line of frustrated passengers. They seemed more interested in chatting, laughing, and eating snacks behind the counter than assisting travelers. When I started recording the chaos, one of the staff members jumped over the counter and threatened to report me to airport security. It was absurd that filming their lack of service was met with such hostility.

SpiceJet's staff, from the counter to the flight attendants, displayed a shocking lack of customer care. The whole experience felt like a chaotic and poorly managed affair.

Never again! Very much disappointed,Charles T,Kochi (Cochin) - Dubai,"29th July, boarding was completed by 11 pm and all passengers were onboard in the aircraft to depart at 11:30. After 2 hrs of long and suffocating waiting they announced that due to technical issues, the flight will not be taking off, so all passengers were requested to get down and be back to the gate. The frustrating part is that they failed to communicate the issue with the passengers were everyone was waiting with patience. Then it started to get auto messages in passengers mobile on next schedule, first at 2:30am on the next day then 11:00am. They offered to stay in the provided accommodation and asked everyone to collect the baggage and do re check in on next day again. That too they were not sure the flight will depart as scheduled as the technical issue was not yet fixed. As I was with family I opted to reschedule it to another day of availability and got it for 3rd August, with the same schedule. On 3rd August I got an email notifying 3.5 hrs of delay and was rescheduled to 3:00am on 4th August. By evening they notified me again about additional 45 minutes delay. 

From 29th flight delay I couldn’t report to work for almost 3 days and I lost the travel expenses to my home and airport.

It's beyond comprehension how they can justify such an exorbitant fee for something as essential as a laptop bag, especially for a student traveler. The staff was unsympathetic and unhelpful, showing no regard for the fact that students often need to carry laptops for their studies.

Eg: If your flight is going to be delayed by 4 hours, then they are going to send you 4 different messages one by one mentioning the flight getting delayed by 1 hour. When you talk to their ground attendants regarding DGCA rules for refreshments and meals due to the delay, they simply say that we had sent out messages and already informed you for a delay of 1 hour which is the worst system loophole that they could've used to prevent themselves from providing the customers with the well deserved compensation.

To make matters worse, I have been trying to reach out to their customer care since morning, but no one is available to address this issue.

Complaint regarding appalling behavior & experience of spicejet staff & delayed flight!,Paradise64418775180,Dubai - Ahmedabad,"Dear SpiceJet Customer Service,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the appalling behavior of your staff at the Dubai airport and the overall poor service on my recent flight from Dubai to Ahmedabad on the 15th of July. The experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I am deeply angered by the unprofessionalism and rudeness displayed by your employees.

We had a minor issue of 2kg excess baggage – 1kg in each of our hand luggage bags. Despite this, your staff insisted on us paying extra. We agreed to comply with the rules and pay the fee, but the manner in which we were treated was absolutely unacceptable. The staff spoke to us in a highly unpleasant and unprofessional tone, completely lacking the basic courtesy of a smile or any form of politeness.

The behavior of your ground staff was so egregious that it has left a lasting negative impression on us. Such ridiculous treatment from airline staff is unheard of and has convinced us never to board SpiceJet again. I will be sharing this horrible experience with my friends and family, urging them to avoid your services as well.

The in-flight experience was no better. The cabin crew was equally rude, and despite asking for water twice, I had to wait for 20 minutes before it was finally served. This lack of basic customer service is simply outrageous.

Additionally, after taking 1kg out of one bag, your staff still demanded payment, continuing their rude demeanor. This entire experience was incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

To add to the misery, the flight, scheduled to take off at 7:20 PM, was initially delayed to 8:00 PM but eventually took off at 9:30 PM, causing further inconvenience and frustration.

Moreover, I was forced to discard some of my personal belongings, including food, in a disgusting manner right outside the entrance. This added to the already horrendous experience. I am attaching an image of the discarded items below.

I demand an explanation for this unacceptable behavior and a formal apology from your team. Such treatment of passengers is disgraceful and should not be tolerated. Having such staff just removes value from your company, showcasing a horrible attitude. 

I was really upset at the time, but now that I think back, I regret not taking the names of the rude staff!!!!!

I look forward to your prompt response and hope that serious measures will be taken to ensure that no other passenger has to endure such a dreadful experience in the future.",International,1.0,July 2024,16 July 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worst airlines....Bad Review for SpiceJet Management.,Nehal P,Dubai - Ahmedabad,"**Bad Review for SpiceJet Management:**

I had an incredibly frustrating experience with SpiceJet regarding a simple just small 3 letters name mismatch issue between my passport and ticket. Despite providing my passport, Emirates ID, and debit card details which is used for this ticket booking, SpiceJet failed to resolve the issue. Their management was shockingly unhelpful and displayed a complete lack of empathy towards customer concerns.

When I visited the SpiceJet office, hoping for a solution, the management's response was cold and dismissive. They outright refused to make any effort to correct the name on my ticket, claiming it was against their policy. It's astonishing that with all the information I provided, they couldn't facilitate a straightforward name modification in their system.

Yesterday, they prevented me from traveling, causing a waste of my time , energy and money.

Their proposed solution was absurd and customer-unfriendly. They insisted that I should forfeit the entire ticket amount and rebook if I wanted to travel. This shows a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and a complete absence of flexibility in their policies.

Overall, my experience with SpiceJet's management was beyond disappointing. They not only failed to address a basic customer service issue but also displayed a lack of professionalism and willingness to assist. I would strongly advise against using SpiceJet if you value competent and customer-centric service.

Spicejet is the worst airline on the earth,Road53824949537,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"I have travelled more than 100 time on airlines and based on my experience Spicejet is the worst airline on earth. 
I recently traveled with SpiceJet on SG 529, from Bengaluru to Delhi on 26 Jun 2024. I did not have any checked-in luggage and was carrying only one carry-on bag, which weighed 9 kg. I was aware of the carry-on baggage policy and was prepared to comply with it. However, the manner in which your boarding staff handled the situation was completely unacceptable. The staff member was extremely rude and arrogant, refusing to allow me to board the flight asked me to pay extra money so I asked them to put my luggage in check-in so that it fits in the luggage policy of (15kg checkin & 7 kg hand baggage) but they denied that also. Another passenger with no luggage offered to help me adjust the weight by sharing some of my items, but the staff at the boarding counter refused to allow this reasonable solution
Despite my attempts to reason with the staff and explain my situation, I was forced to leave several personal items at the airport, which was both distressing and inconvenient. The entire experience was unpleasant and left me feeling humiliated. Such inflexibility only added to my frustration and disappointment with SpiceJet's service.

Additionally, I would like to bring to attention to an earlier bad experience with SpiceJet. In December 2022, my family and I (a total of four members) traveled from Gwalior to Mumbai. During this trip, we had 15,000 rupees stolen from our checked-in luggage. I filed a complaint regarding this theft on spicejet customer care no. but to date, no resolution has been provided by SpiceJet.",Domestic,1.0,June 2024,25 June 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Racism & Rude Behavior of SpiceJet Crew,Ishiqa Vaibhav Sharma,New Delhi - Bangkok,"PNR Number TBM9XC

My husband and I recently traveled from Delhi to Bangkok by Spicejet SG87 on 14th June 2024 departure at 2140hrs, seat # 31G&H. To begin with, the flight was delayed, we boarded at 9.15 and it was mentioned in the lounge that the gate had closed. We ran like hell from the lounge, left our food and coffee to witness that the boarding gate had a long queue to board the bus first to enter the aircraft which took another 25 mins, and finally approx. 9.15 pm we were in the aircraft. While sitting and waiting for half an hour to fly, we realized the flight was delayed as it finally flew at 10.30. Meanwhile, there were kids, elderly people, and the younger generation who wanted to know the status or asked for water from the crew, they were yelled at. The crew was 95% non-Indian, including 03 women and 2 males (what I remember) and for the first time, I realised what racism is. One of the honeymoon couples asked for water, and a male crew came and yelled at the husband that if you kept ringing the bell, we wouldn’t prepare the food trolley and I was right behind that couple. I could see the embarrassment he faced in front of his newly married-wife. One of the families who had 5 college-going travelers with them, changed their seat with a fellow passenger with mutual understanding. One of the female crew came and started yelling at the mother saying with what permission have you changed the seats? Did you put in a request to us before changing it the passenger explained that we had requested the fellow passenger, and they did not have any issues though she rudely spoke to the father (60+) whose birthday trip it was. I was furious at them and wanted to record their behaviors; the entire flight was talking about their behaviors and were not comfortable asking anything from them. One of the boys' groups of 5 had different seats and 2 sat on their respective seats which were different from each other and remaining 3 asked the crew if they could get a seat together however they did not know English what I noticed was again making fun of them and showing rudeness.

From a delayed flight, the least expectation one has is politeness and consideration from the crew. Offering water is basic though instead of asking, passengers were yelled at. I have taken a few pictures of seats which were all dirty, broken, etc. It was the first and the last trip with SpiceJet. I expect an apology from Spicejet for the racism I saw towards Indian passengers and rudeness. #boycottspicejet #spicejetapologies #dontravelwithspicejet

Horrible Experience,Qirat S,Srinagar - Mumbai,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service provided by SpiceJet on 19th June 2024. I had originally booked flight SG8386 from Srinagar to Mumbai. Shockingly, the flight was cancelled just 8 hours before departure, leaving me with very little time to make alternative arrangements.
 
Despite the inconvenience, I rebooked a flight for the same day, which was crucial as I had a connecting flight from Mumbai to Dubai. Unfortunately, upon rebooking with SpiceJet from Srinagar to Delhi, the flight was delayed by 1 hour and 15 minutes. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight from Delhi to Mumbai, further complicating my travel plans.
 
Throughout this ordeal, I experienced horrible customer service. The representatives I interacted with were extremely unprofessional and displayed a lack of empathy and understanding. The entire situation was handled poorly, with no consideration for the significant inconvenience caused to me.
 
As a result of these disruptions, I had to spend twice the amount initially planned due to last-minute bookings and missed connections. The financial burden and stress caused by this experience were unacceptable.
 
I urge SpiceJet to take immediate action to improve their customer service standards and ensure such incidents do not happen in the future. This experience has severely tarnished my perception of SpiceJet, and I hope they take necessary steps to rectify their shortcomings.

It became one hour more. After, when we arrived the luggage was coming out at several places. First it was ok but then the place was changed. It was a timetaking flight experience and with no experience. Even a local bus is equal to that flight. So I suggest that you should book a Indigo ticket. It was the worst,worst and worst experience.

They asked me to email customer services for a refund. To date I have not received a single penny even after stating that they will reimburse me.
When I got back to England I rang my credit company and explained the problem.  They refunded me whilst they investigated but later took back the money as they agreed with spice jet that I had not followed their terms and conditions that I ticked when booking .
What a joke! Normally when you pay for something you get a booking reference number so you can pursue your goods or service. 
Luckily I didn't book twice instead I booked with Air India who were delightful and got us to Mumbai on time for our flight back to London.

It was two kgs up but i pleaded that i had no check in and these items will break. They asked us all to pay a fine or they won't let
us board. They refused to listen to me or any other passenger. They even locked the gate and announced that boarding it complete. This was absolute nonsense and bullying. On top of that they wanted to take the luggage for check in and refused to put a fragile tag. Clearly this is your way of making money and you have fallen to such a low level.

A day before I was informed that my flight is rescheduled for 9.45am. I checked the internet it showed the 8am flight is scheduled on time and there is another flight of SG at 9.45am with same flight number. I called the airlines and they were very stern and as the reschedule was within 3 hours, it is not refundable. So without any other option left, I did the web check in. Airlines send me the boarding pass 3 hours later which mentions my flight timing as 10.45am without any intimation for re re schedule. Again I checked internet which was showing that 8am and 9.45am flights are still scheduled at their own time.
There is big fraud going on with this airline where I suppose they keep on taking the bookings till the end and charge very high.

Feedback on Recent Flight Experience -Below average,Sightsee26805392729,Dubai - Kozhikode,"I recently traveled with spicejet from Dubai to Calicut on 15/05/2024. I would like to provide feedback on my experience, particularly concerning the seating arrangements, additional charges for extra weight, and the conduct of the staff.

Firstly, I found the seating on the flight to be excessively congested. The limited legroom and narrow seats made the journey uncomfortable and less than ideal, especially for a longer flight. This lack of space significantly impacted my ability to relax and enjoy the flight.

Additionally, I was taken aback by the strictness regarding extra weight charges. While I understand the importance of adhering to weight regulations for safety reasons, the fees imposed seemed quite high and were applied with little flexibility or understanding. This added unexpected stress and financial burden to my travel experience.

Furthermore, the demeanor of some staff members was less than satisfactory. I found their approach to enforcing rules to be overly rigid and lacking in empathy. A more customer-friendly and understanding attitude would greatly enhance the overall travel experience.

I hope you will consider this feedback and make necessary improvements to ensure a more comfortable and pleasant journey for your passengers in the future.",International,1.0,April 2024,15 May 2024,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

SpiceJet - a shameless looter that looks for ways to harrass customers,Kumar A,Patna - New Delhi,"I unfortunately flew on SG8478 on 6th May from Patna to Delhi and completely shocked to see how SpiceJet is looting it's customers through it's  croocked modus operandi. I had just one bag which I thought was around 10kgs and a laptop bag. As I had web checked so I directly dashed to the gate and waited. For the 9.45pm flight, they started boarding at around 9.15pm, and while checking my boarding pass the staff asked another person by the name of Kanish Kumar, who was already weighing some bags of other customers to weigh my bag. As general practice, sometimes the airlines do ask people to put their bags in luggage than cabin if it's more than 7-8 Kgs, so calmly moved aside and told the other staff I had only one bag and no luggage. He did not respond anything but just continued to weigh my bag and said it's 11 Kgs and then asked me to give my laptop bag for weighing, so I was baffled...I said its a small laptop bag why do you need to wiegh that but he said he has to check the total weight. He weighed it and said 4 kgs so total of 15kgs and I have to pay Rs 3000. I said I have only one bag and even including laptop bag it's well within 15kgs of allowed limit. I Said you put my bag in laggage if you want. So, he responded ""thats not my work"". I said no problem, I can myself go and give as there's still time. He said no baggage loading counter is now closed and if I wanted to board then I have to pay. Just at this another staff by the name of Shaheela Parveen, quickly pounded on me and said I was too much time. This lady was immensely badly behaved and I told her that I will file a formal complaint for your behaviour and this act of cheating customers. She was least bothered and said fine now you have to payRs 4800 ans earlier we were giving you Rs1800 discount. I asked her charge me in full if she is is sure that this is how they operate. Working for bad company is alright but it was sad to see someone with such a bad upbringing as well, it seems SpiceJets selects such people as they need rowdies than hospitality staffs!

It was clear to me that this is by design and Spice jet wants these staff to fleece the passengers! Spice Jet you are True disgrace to the Indian hospitality sector and a shame to the Indian aviation industry.

Really think hard before falling for their cheap tickets, they will make you repent later. I have flown 4-5 times in Spice Jet, an this was the final one almost every time I have experienced change in schedule/ delayed flight, horrific landing as if they dump the flight on runways on landing, badly behaved flight staff and crew....so on and so forth.I would rather take a bus ride than risking it with Spice Jet ever again.

To Spice Jet I would only say - I know you guys are struggling but do some soul searching if there is any shame left. You are looting people  broad day light and risking lives. If you think a business can be saved by stealing by cheating customers then you are wrong g my friend!

Worst airline,SALES P,Bagdogra - Ahmedabad,"Terrible experience. This was the only direct flight from bagdogra to Ahmedabad. Our check in luggage was underweight. I had a laptop bag n a hand luggage which was 7 kgs.
When I was entering the gate, I was stopped, for the very first time in my travel history and they weighed my laptop bag too, I was shocked to see that. 
I was charged 600 per kg.
There were many people who had the purse n hand luggage with them, but I didn't see them weighing anyone's luggage. They targeted me n my son and charged us heavily.
Though the airline fare was less in comparison to other airlines but they try to procure that difference amount from the luggage weights. 
The rules should be same for everyone.

Being in travel industry I will never recommend anyone spicejet n will never board spicejet flight again.

Excellent..!,Dr I S,Pune - New Delhi,"Kudos to the improvement in services in time. I am frequent flyer I fly
every week sometimes twice a week. And mostly I fly with indigo or airindia.
 I flew with SpiceJet ( SG 184 Pune to delhi ) and my experience
has been so good. SpiceJet Flying is better than Indigo and vistara ( In
vistara I everytime feel I am in Laxman jhula )while food is better than any
other airline it was fresh yummy and perfect with respect to nutrition.
Paneer was so fresh, so was beans and rice as well . Sweet was also a
sophicated one. With too much visible turbulence in weather also pilot sir
managed to flew well. And unlike indigo crew didn’t say no to serve tea. Tea
was also of very good quality . Food was better than many of the restaurants
I dine in. With this sort of service SpiceJet airline can easily overshadow
indigo I recommend SpiceJet to people and will request Government to
motivate airlines like these grow more

PLEASE READ: Do not trust spicejet. Do not ignore the reviews.,Climber32541251935,Hyderabad - Chennai (Madras),"Everyone knows the reputation spicejet has. I chose to ignore it and had booked a round trip with spicejet Hyderabad - Chennai.

On my flight to Chennai, I had a terrible experience.

The flight was already delayed by an hour. I did not have a checkin bag, and only had cabin. I was asked to pay 1800rs extra for my laptop bag. I've never faced this with any other airline. They waited for the flight checkin to close to start checking the bags. I was forced to pay the full amount, but they gave a discount for the passenger who came after me. Not fair.

During the takeoff, the engine (and in turn the AC) was turned on in the last moment to save fuel. Even after landing, as we were waiting for 10 minutes to find a place to deboard, the engine was turned off to save fuel.

The flying experience was also not good, a bathroom door that kept making noise in the air - it was loose I guess. 

It's really surprising that spicejet is still operating.

Coming to my return flight (at 8:45am), I was hoping it would be smooth. But again, just at the time of checking in my baggage (7:35am), I get message that the flight has been rescheduled to 12noon. 

Upon checking with the staff they said the flight was supposed to come from Ahmedabad to Chennai, before going to Hyderabad, but due to technical reasons got sent back mid way. Even the 12noon was just an estimate and it can get delayed further.

There was no other airline having a flight earlier than that too. And obviously now with higher prices since it's last minute. But anyways I took this as a punishment for booking Spicejet. Took a full refund (which is pennies compared to the fare of my new booking and the cab from and to the airport again) and booked with a different airline.

I chose to ignore the other reviews, I hope you don't. Spicejet was bad, is bad and will be bad. I don't see how one can trust their life on Spicejet when they're this unreliable.",Domestic,1.0,April 2024,27 April 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

SpiceJet cancelled flights for my family and refused to refund us! We were left out of pocket. BEWARE!!,Virginia R,Kochi (Cochin) - Hyderabad,"TLDR: They cancelled our flight - refused to refund us. SpiceJet cancelled our flights (2 pax) and rescheduled us to the following day.

I asked for a confirmation number for the refund, or some evidence that it would be refunded, but the rep said that all calls were recorded and that he would not provide any evidence, the recorded call was enough. 
The refund never came. 
I spent a total 3 hours on hold/calls and half a dozen emails over 2 months, at each step of the way they started from zero, threw up barriers, asking for information they had on file - it didn't feel like an genuine attempt to gather data, rather it seemed like a way find obscure information that might be hard to produce to frustrate people into giving up.

Disappointed,Expedition735508,Dubai - New Delhi,"Dear SpiceJet,

I want to express my disappointment regarding my recent flight experience from Dubai to Delhi on 6th April 2024. As a frequent traveler, I was shocked by the lack of communication and transparency regarding luggage fees. It was extremely frustrating to be charged an additional 210 AED at the boarding counter for exceeding the 3 kg weight limit including duty free in my cabin bag especially when I was not informed about it earlier when dropping off my check-in 1 pcs of bag only 20kg. The presence of a weight machine and cash collection book beside the boarding gate was not only surprising but also highly inconvenient. This experience has left a negative impression, and I hope that you will take steps to improve communication and customer service in the future.

Another issue with this company, comparing with others in the domestic India sector, is the lack of kindness, of professional behaviour of the ground staff. From the luggages screening to the check in, they act like frustrated and even arrogant people towards their customers.

As a customer, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can occur, but it's essential for airlines to prioritize customer service and take proactive steps to resolve such issues. Unfortunately, my experience with SpiceJet fell short in this regard.

I urge SpiceJet to improve its baggage handling procedures and enhance communication with passengers regarding luggage issues. It's crucial for airlines to demonstrate accountability and provide timely updates to affected customers.

WORST OF ALL TIME AND WORST EVER POSSIBLE,Roving61413158157,Shirdi - Bengaluru,"To everyone reading this review,
Before sharing my experience I'd very strongly recommend everyone to never choose this as your flying partner. This is the WORST airlines company I've ever come across in my lifetime. SPICEJET AIRWAYS and DELAY are two words with same meaning. The reason I say this is stated below :

Departing from Shirdi, being Bengaluru as the destination, this ridiculous airline company delayed its flight by 3 hours first.
It was initially scheduled at 9:40 a.m and then rescheduled to 12:30 p.m
Everyone around was already frustrated from this incident and then the upcoming announcement literally flared up everyone from within.
This piece of crap airlines delayed the take off time of aircraft by 45 minutes again.
Everyone around was so frustrated that a group of men and women literally quarrelled with the company's attendant. The passengers consisted of aged as well as young kids and no compensation was made for thier inconvenience. Hungry and tired, longing to reach Bengaluru, the passengers were yelling aloud and it was an absolute mess at the airport. This airlines is the best airlines IF YOU WANT TO GET IRRITATED AND ANGRY AND HUNGRY.
""NO ONE SHOULD CHOOSE SPICEJET AIRLINES"" was the cry at the airport.
The airline staff was NOT GOOD TOWARDS THE PASSENGERS.
The attitude and absolute lack of regret shown by the airline staff caught everyone's anger and became another reason for everyone's hatred towards SPICEJET AIRLINES.
This is definitely not the first time SPICEJET AIRLINES has let people down, because this AIRWAY COMPANY is very famous for causing inconvenience to the passengers.
It really seems like the goal of SPICEJET AIRWAYS IS TO CAUSE MOST INCONVENIENCE TO PEOPLE CHOOSING IT.
It would rather be a HAPPY MOMENT if this piece of crap in the name of airways SHUTS DOWN FOR GOOD.

If you're seeking a nightmare in the skies, look no further than SpiceJet – the epitome of incompetence and indifference. My recent experience on flight SG 612 from Chennai to Mumbai was a harrowing journey into the abyss of despair, leaving me and countless others stranded without an ounce of compassion or support.

The saga began with a delay that stretched into eternity, as we, the hapless passengers, were kept waiting until the clock struck 11:30, only to be met with the devastating news of cancellation. But that was just the beginning of our ordeal. Instead of offering solace or assistance, SpiceJet's ground staff callously brushed aside our concerns with a chilling declaration of apathy: ""We don't care, we can't help.""

As a traveler with a 4-year-old and 4-month-old baby in tow, the callousness exhibited by SpiceJet staff is unforgivable. With no provisions for accommodation, transportation, or even basic empathy, we were left stranded at the mercy of circumstance, with no regard for the well-being of vulnerable passengers.

But perhaps what is most egregious is SpiceJet's blatant disregard for the dignity of its patrons. Amidst the chaos and confusion, their mantra of indifference echoed like a cruel joke, a stark reminder of their utter lack of respect for humanity.

I implore anyone considering air travel to heed this warning: steer clear of SpiceJet. Spare yourself the agony, frustration, and humiliation that come hand in hand with their abysmal service.

VERY BAD TRAVELING EXPERIENCE WITH MY BABY,Fasna A,Kozhikode - Dubai,"I had a very unpleasant experience on my Spice Jet flight from Kozhikode to Dubai on 11/03/2024. I traveled with my 8-month-old baby. I had 30kg, 7kg, and 7kg of luggages, as well as a stroller and handbag. I requested the staff to put my both 7kg bags in luggage as I was alone travelling with my baby and i need to carry stroller and hand bag with me but they are refused to take my bags. Considering mothers and babies is important; I asked for 10 minutes, but they were not helpful. Afterward, the staff asked why I brought two bags when I was traveling with a baby*. SERIOUSLY !!! IS THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR YOU EXHIBIT TOWARDS YOUR CUSTOMERS?? THEN WHY DID YOU MENTION BAGGAGE IN YOUR FLIGHT STATUS!!*! In the end, I had to carry two bags that were 7kg, a stroller, and a small handbag (baby food and diapers) with me. This is not my first flight with baby, in all other flights they had put my cabin bag in luggage as they give importantance to mothers and babies but Spice jet Very very bitter experience. Also the front seat was broken and it was in sliding position, we had a very little space in front of us and I don’t know how I sit there with my baby. I requested the crew to change my seat and they informed me that once the flight begins, they will inform me of any available seats. But I didn’t get any window seat as it was my special request while boarding since I had to feed my baby.

"SPICEJET is a biggest SCAM, DO NOT book it",Sightsee40664651595,Amritsar - Dubai,"SpiceJet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience. Traveling with my family, a total of six individuals, we embarked on a journey from Amritsar (ATQ), India to DXB (Dubai) on February 24, 2024. The scheduled departure time was 08:40 AM, with a connecting flight from Dubai to London Heathrow at 14:30 Hrs via Emirates. Our ticket was booked through the booking.com portal as a single ticket, rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection.

However, our experience with SpiceJet quickly turned sour. Departing from ATQ, the flight was delayed by 55 minutes. Upon arrival in Dubai, we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation. Initially, we were given excuses regarding weather conditions, despite the clear and sunny day in Dubai, and the optimal weather conditions for takeoff. Eventually, a member of the ground staff revealed the truth - the delay was due to SpiceJet's scheduling issues and the busy nature of Dubai Airport.

This delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to London Heathrow. Expecting assistance from SpiceJet, we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution. However, to our dismay, they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions. Their staff was unhelpful and dismissive, leaving us stranded in Dubai with our children. Consequently, we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the UK.

I feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airline's deceptive practices. SpiceJet's lack of accountability and disregard for customer welfare make them a company to avoid at all costs.

But i was disappointed to know after collecting baggage from domestic terminal, heading to International that checkin counters will open just 3 hours before with no spicejet rep on site. 

I understand the convenience of saving money on rent and also manpower by doing so but the management of spicejet should atleast wonder why customers are opting for other carriers rather than choosing their company. Travellers love better customer service and visibility. 

Customers are happy to pay more if the service is right,  you don't need to pull money out of their pockets by creating hand luggage policies which only favor you.

Completely disappointed,Paradise16843138455,Goa - Mumbai,"My mother and I chose Spicejet to travel from Goa to Mumbai in February 2024. We have always had issues in regards to flight delays with Spicejet in the past, but we decided to give it a go one last time, plus their flight schedule was the best personal choice for us for that particular day. I am sad to write that we experienced an even worser experience with Spicejet this time around than we usually do, in regards to time organization. I usually do not write reviews for airlines, but this time I feel it necessary. To cut a long story short, upon rushing us to go to the boarding gate before the actual boarding time commensed, we stood in line for about 25 minutes like sheep waiting to be loaded on the airplane. So we were hence late in our departure (as usual). However, to make it even worse, once we landed in Mumbai, they stuffed us in a bus to the extent that the doors could not close. It then took a few minutes for them to fix this technical bus issue. Following this, they transported us to Terminal 1 to collect our luggage. Yet, low and behold, the luggage belt was not coming on for a good 20 minutes, with all passengers standing around the belt looking confused. One Spicejet ground hostess was passing by so customers were asking her what is going on. She informed us that because the flight arrived at Terminal 2 the luggage may take a while till it arrives at our location (i.e. terminal 1). Now, the issue is not only delay in time, but also the lack of communication and extreme mismanagement of time and customer service. The least we would expect is the flight hostess or captain informing us prior to us disembarking that there will be a time delay in collecting our luggage (particularly with respect to passengers who are catching another domestic or international flight). 

All in all, I say this to Spicejet directly: you make your flying customers come to the airport and present themselves on time, and respect their airlines' departure schedule, yet you fail to respect our own time by making us wait approximately 30 minutes for our luggage, and without even informing us or providing a shred of communication in regards to the same. It's outrageous.
I think I speak on behalf of everyone on the flight when I say that we are all very disappointed with the service of Spicejet. 
To that I say, 'Spice it up' Spicejet, in terms of your customer service, respect, and decency...For your own good!",Domestic,3.0,January 2024,9 February 2024,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

Worst Experience,Ryan P,Goa - Bengaluru,"Goa Mopa to Bangalore.

The original departure time was 6 55 pm from Goa Mopa airport reaching Bangalore at 8 15 pm. I then get a message that the flight was now delayed to depart at 8 30 pm.

The reason I booked this flight is because I had a connecting Malaysian Airline flight to Kuala Lumpur and then Melbourne which was to depart at 12 20 am on Jan 11th 2024.

So even though we were told that the flight SG 2910 was delayed to 8 30 pm, the flight eventually left at 9 05 pm. I spoke to the ground staff at Mopa explaining that I had a connecting flight to Melbourne and they told me that someone would be there at Bangalore airport to assist.

The flight then landed at Bangalore at 10 45 pm which means that there was a delay over the delay. Due to this, I was not able to reach the Malaysian counter on time and I missed my flight to KL and then Melbourne.

There was no one to assist me from Spice Jet and to add to all the stress and delays, I had to book new air tickets to Bangkok and then to Melbourne.

The total cost of this came to about AUD 1500 and I lost out on my flights that I paid for.

Not just the money list but the stress and anxiety created by them. 

Now they are not willing to even talk to me and offer me even a cent.

I am not sure how the civil aviation authority is allowing these clowns to run an airline like this. If it were Australia, they would have had their licence cancelled.

I also had issues with wheelchair assistance as he disappeared after baggage checkin and left me stranded in front of a door. It was extremely cold. He also demanded Rs.500 for picking up my luggage and additional tip. He altogether wanted Rs. 1100. I had to forcibly pay Rs. 700. With lots of difficulty I managed managed to walk back to spicejet counter to get me another wheelchair assistance. The 2nd guy had multiple issues to hold my hand luggage.

Pathetic,Happiness41807174078,Hyderabad - New Delhi,"I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction and disappointment with the recent series of incidents that transpired during my journey with SpiceJet Airlines, involving flight delays, misinformation, and a severe lapse in communication. I am hopeful that this grievance will be addressed promptly and that appropriate measures will be taken to rectify the situation.

I, P Vamshi Krishna Reddy, had booked a round-trip ticket with SpiceJet for my travel from Hyderabad to Delhi on January 30, 2024, and return on the same day, with the following details:

Departure: SpiceJet SG 160, Hyderabad to Delhi, PNR No: C6SHFL, Departure Time: 06.00 am (Actual Departure: 8.30 am)
Return: SpiceJet SG 261, Delhi to Hyderabad, PNR No: C6SHFL, Departure Time: 20.55, Revised departure time is 23.30 and then preponed to 22.30

I faced significant inconveniences during both legs of my journey, as the morning flight was delayed by 2.30 hours due to bad weather. Subsequently, the return flight's departure time was preponed without any prior notification, leading to an egregious situation where I missed my flight even though I was waiting for flight in the lounge since 6.00 PM in the airport. Moreover, the airline's operations seemed disorganized, akin to local buses, which is a serious departure from the expected standards of a reputable airline.

The lack of communication and the discrepancy in information provided by SpiceJet staff, particularly Mr. ASIF, Senior Executive, is highly regrettable. Despite my efforts to seek assistance, Mr. ASIF exhibited a negligent attitude, offering no resolution to my predicament and suggesting that I raise a complaint with customer care.",Domestic,1.0,January 2024,31 January 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

A Nightmare Experience with Lost Baggage – Avoid SpiceJet at All Costs.,Marie E,Bangkok - Mumbai,"I am compelled to share my horrendous experience with SpiceJet, particularly their appalling handling of my lost baggage. This has been, without exaggeration, the worst airline experience I've ever endured.

During my trip to Mumbai, my baggage was lost. What followed was a two-month ordeal of nearly daily calls to their customer service, which has proven to be a study in frustration and ineffectiveness. The lack of clear information and solutions from SpiceJet was astounding. Each call felt like starting from scratch – different versions of the story, no continuity in communication, and an apparent total disconnection between departments.

Their email communication is just as unresponsive. Not a single one of my numerous emails received a reply, leaving me in a constant state of uncertainty about the status of my baggage. It's as if once they lose your luggage, you, as a customer, cease to exist in their system.

The most distressing part is the sheer indifference and inconsistency in their responses. There's a glaring lack of accountability and customer care, making me feel utterly disregarded and helpless. It's been a never-ending loop of unfulfilled promises and conflicting information.

Based on my experience, I strongly advise against using SpiceJet. Their handling of customer issues, particularly lost baggage, is abysmal. No traveler should have to go through what I did. It’s more than just about lost baggage; it's about a total failure in customer service and respect. Fly with them at your own risk, but if you value your peace of mind and your belongings, look elsewhere.",Asia,1.0,November 2023,18 January 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Absolute Nightmare of an airline,Sightsee35380092804,Khajuraho - New Delhi,"Absolutely the worst airline, with obnoxious and rude ground and flight staff. 
Insisted that me and my friend check in expensive camera equipment. In all my time travelling never have i come across such insensitive and  horrible staff. 
While the lady at the counter objected to the weight of my carry on with cameras and lenses, she was quite all right if i carried the same in my hand or shoved a few cameras in my jacket pocket. No other airline would even suggest something so outrageous. 
In my experience Indigo, Vistara, Air India and even Akasa is more than accommodating when they see you are carrying expensive camera gears. 

Oh not to mention the last time i flew Spice jet, which was probably in 2019, they broke my suitcase, and received the response from the ground staff, that a) it was already broken, b) the suitcase brand wasn't a great one. BTW it was a VIP. Sever complaints and follow up's later, I  still haven't heard back from them

The flight got delayed by 2 hours first and then before 3 hours again it got delayed by half an hour, with a total of 2 hours 30 mins in total.

Additionally, at the counter they asked to me weight my bag and excess 1 kg was coming for which they have charged extra for baggage..

When I spoke with the agent in the counter about the inconvenience we people are facing. The staff replied , not my concern ..the excess 1 kg weight is not related to the delay. 
Just worst customer handling by Spicejet staff.
No compensation even... 
Even I checked the past departure time of the same flight and was shocked to see the delay..
Someday it was delayed by 4 hours, some by 6 and on 29th dec it was delayed by 12 hours...

The Frustrating Tale of SpiceJet's Continuous Delays,Asha K,New Delhi - Hyderabad,"We had pre-booked flight tickets from Delhi to Hyderabad, expecting a 7 am departure. Unfortunately, the flight experienced multiple delays: first pushed to 8 am, then further delayed to 10:50 am, 11 am, and finally 12:15 pm. These continuous delays were quite challenging for us, significantly disrupting our schedule. The airline's inefficiency led to a waste of our precious time. When we requested lounge access due to the prolonged delay, the airline offered a meal instead.

There were murmurs among passengers about SpiceJet's limited staffing and flights, suggesting that they might be playing games with travelers. One unfortunate individual missed their flight and sought assistance from the airline but received no support; instead, they were advised to purchase a new, expensive ticket.

Overall, the lack of support and the series of delays left us deeply dissatisfied. Based on this experience, I strongly advise against booking a flight with SpiceJet, even if they offer enticing deals.",Domestic,1.0,December 2023,27 December 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

A Never-Ending Delay Nightmare with SpiceJet,Camper39240804654,Kochi (Cochin) - Dubai,"I recently had the misfortune of flying with SpiceJet, and I feel compelled to share my dreadful experience. The airline's consistently abysmal on-time performance turned what should have been a routine journey into an endurance test.

For several weeks in a row, spicejet flights ( Dubai to kochi and back ) with SpiceJet were plagued by delays ranging from 8 hours to a staggering 4 hours. It seemed as though punctuality was a concept lost on them. Despite the inconvenience caused to passengers, the airline's management displayed a shocking lack of interest in resolving this chronic issue.

If you cherish your time and well-being, I strongly advise against considering SpiceJet, even if you're enticed by the seemingly economical ticket prices. The continuous delays not only tested my patience but also left me stranded at the airport without any timely notice or explanation.

SpiceJet's management team appears to be utterly devoid of any skill when it comes to running an airline efficiently. If spending 8 hours or more waiting aimlessly in an airport terminal is your idea of a perfect travel experience, then by all means, choose SpiceJet. However, for those who value their time and sanity, it's best to steer clear of this airline and explore other options that prioritize passenger satisfaction and punctuality.",International,1.0,December 2023,25 December 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

The worst part was that all the passenger detail verifications were being made manually with no computers what so ever and the baggage tags were being written by hand. Since all that was being done manually, when we got to checkin, he kept searching for our name on the printed out roster for about 10 mins until I had to point out that he was looking at a roster that was 2 days old and he went off to search for the latest one.

Nightmare Experience with Spicejet Airlines,Odyssey68398559473,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"Nightmare Experience with Spicejet Airlines Actually I never slept

Flying with Spicejet  Airlines was an absolute disaster from start to finish. Their customer service was atrocious.

The flight itself was delayed multiple times without any clear communication or updates, leaving passengers stranded and frustrated for hours on end. Once aboard, the conditions were appalling—the seats were uncomfortable, cramped, and filthy, making the journey unbearable.

I strongly advise against choosing Spicejet Airlines for any future travels. The lack of professionalism, terrible service, and overall disregard for passenger comfort made this the worst airline experience I've ever had.""",Domestic,1.0,November 2023,17 December 2023,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,3.0,1.0,1.0,N/A

I had a flight from BOM to GAU in the morning at 6:40 AM and when I went to check in my luggage, i have noticed full of crowd at the counter. No one from Spice jet ground staff bodard to manage the crowd as Spice jet staff dose not have any managemnt skill. There was one Ground staff who was allowing passangers to break the lines. Because of that ground staff whole checkn in counter got over croweded and passangers were getting delay for their boaeding pass and rushed to the departure gate. I was in the line for 2 hours only because of that ground staff and bad management skill. I was travelling from USA to Guwahati. But it was the worst expeiance for me.

1. Flight got delayed from departure ( from 2:15 to 2:50)
2. There was a layover at Delhi which was not mentioned in the ticket/pass. At Jammu airport, they said it will be 30mins layover and i have to remain seated.
3. After reaching Delhi they told me the timing has been changed, so now i have to wait around 3hrs at delhi airport and then board the plane again. So i waited at delhi airport ( they gave a cheap food coupon with only one meal choice , I felt really cheated as i choose spicejet over indigo assuming i will get to destination soon without any layovers.)
4. After reaching Hyd i started waiting for my bag at the belt, the belt stopped and my bag didn't came. There were 4 other people also with me whose bags didn't came, the spicejet guy there said bags are coming in lift as they are fragile ( well none of the bags were fragile ).
5. Bags came in the lift all the people got their bags except me. My bag was not there, they said that one bag has missing tag, ( the tag was ripped and lying on the lift floor) so they stopped it and it will come on the belt again, now i waited for like another half an hour for my bag.
6. Finally my bag came, first thing observed was that the small steel lock on my bag was missing, i asked them and they said ""It must have broken somehow"". I dont know how a steel lock got broken somehow just by moving b/w planes but at this time. When i confronted the spicejet guy again he started behaving rudely.

Horrible service and mindless rescheduling of plane,Tour21323504001,Mumbai - Kolkata (Calcutta),"My original flight was to take off from Mumbai at 7pm, on 9/11/2023.
 I had plans accordingly. Only the day before the departure, quite late at night, they casually just dropped a text message informing that the flight has been preponed by 10 hours, without even thinking about the problem the passengers will have to face. 
I had to replan my entire day hurriedly and suffered quite a loss due to loss of an entire day. But spicejet did not give any kind of compensation.

On the next day, that is 9th november, we boarded the plane at 10am, which was the scheduled time , but the plane did not take off till 12pm, this caused significant delay and anxiety in all our programmes. The captain did not even have the decency to explain the cause of delay to the passengers. We just sat inside the aircraft clueless for more than 1 hour. 

This horrible kind of service has made me determined not to ever use this goddamned airlines again. Spicejet only thinks of the passengers as money making machines, and it's high time we show them their place.

To make matters worse, not a single morsel of food or even a cup of water was provided during the entire ordeal.

On a happy note I started my journey to the airport I got a call saying the flight is being cancelled. Not just 48 hours at least before 24 hours this information could have been passed. No you guys will not do that since you are having a good customer relationship and service as well.

You guys were not even ready to schedule another flight and take care of the passengers. I called the customer care and even begged the employee in the airport to reschedule another flight or to at least to another flight (in which there are another flight at 2:30 AM in the same date flight SG 8136 where my friends were traveling) or other airlines. Later on, few of my co-passengers were able to get seats in the 2.30 am flight which was very unfair and unethical.

I had a very personal emergency to reach Delhi as soon as possible before early afternoon. I had NO OTHER OPTION TO BOOK ANOTHER FLIGHT costing INR 21,551 which is 3x that which I paid. (Please view the attachment)

Financially draining experience,S_Das,Bagdogra - Guwahati,"SpiceJet may cancel a flight 30 mins before departure without any prior notice and expects the passengers to be fine with it. They will not provide any accommodation or proper refreshments even if the next alternate flight is after 12hrs.
They will give you bogus reply and try to make up things.
Next time if you are thinking of travelling via Spicejet you may as well be prepared to be stranded in the airport and pay the exorbitant price of accomodation and make arrangements for alternate travel plans from your own pocket.
When you contact customer service they will say they will look into it and then you will not get any reply afterwards. 
In Air Seva they just make up excuses and then mark the grivence as resolved.
Be carefully and cautious while choosing Spicejet.
Also while going through the reviews for Spicejet you will find most people rating Spicejet as excellent has only 1 contribution. I can expect some people finding only Spicejet as excellent is possible but for so many people, I don't know  it's fishy? Maybe only my opinion.

SpiceJet doesn't have a great track record when it comes to quality customer service do not book spicejet,Archana G,Pune - Dharamsala,"this letter to make a complaint regarding misguided, misinformation, poor service , Discrimination, harsh staff and spicejet flight delay of (SG-8184) from Pune to (New Delhi).It is the first time that I have faced such cases. Passengers buy expensive tickets because they have important work to do or to be at their desired place for an important reason. But I guess you people do not consider our engagements or tasks important.

I had a ticket from Pune to Delhi then Delhi to Kangra Gaggal. Unfortunately the flight got delay and was not aware as I am employee in hotel where management do not allowed us to carry phone on duty.
I have called to spicejet customer care at 09:18pm on 4th sept to know the status and one of your crew members stated over the phone that flight will depart from Pune at 2:30am on 5th September early morning which was incorrect information I received . I reached at the airport by 12:50am and asked to airport crew staff from where I need to go to spicejet. He has mentioned that from last gate. I was in the line and it was long line. I asked again one more crew staff and he mentioned I need to go to inside from first entry gate from where you sent (almost I lost all time there becouse my mistake was asking help from your crew staff) I rushed to the direction then I stopped by police and said me to show the ticket. I have presented my ticket on the phone but he did not understand and asked me more details (again wasted my time, please go through CC tv camera. Allmost I have lost my valuable time.

Then I went to check in counter and with me there were three more passengers (1 lady and two guy) at the same time they allowed to travel but they denied me. I was shell shocked and thought why discrimination with me ???? At check in counter there were two crew guy and one girl apart from one guy was very peevish & harsh behaviour. (If I am not wrong Gate closes 45 Minutes before departure.pls understand the valu of seconds as well). I was asking for help and he even did not ask and saying that they will not allow to check in me. I asked simple question we were 4 people at the same time all three passenger allowed why I am not even my seat number is (21c). He stated that its my fault I reached late. I stated everything that I got information that flight will depart by 2:30am from your customer care staff and your crew staff wasted my time outside while entering inside. They said that they don't care if I got information from gurgaon crew Member's or outside of the airport. It seems they are not representing spicejet airlines they represent their own job in Pune region only. When I asked for help they said only no no no no. They did not listen to me and blaming everything on me. Why they said to me becouse I was very calm did not create drama etc (pls go through CC tv camera). The same time they told me if I need to travel i need to make quickly fresh reservation I said how come it possible if you don't allow me with my current ticket. What is the use of new tickets??? Still I am in depression by this question(pathetic).

Finally I asked for complaint but all the time they had word on their mouth that everywhere passenger was faulty. Finally I lost my hope and I was heading outside. Suddenly the counter lady came to me and forced me to show the photo id. She said please go outside. I was very calm and was very upset and thinking when I am going to outside why they need to take my ID (I felt it was a big slap on my face). Spicejet team  if I was very calm and respectful at all time it's  your responsibility to show respect not feel someone धक्के मार कर बाहर निकालना.This is the worst airline company I encountered. 

After all this insult i called to spicejet team and mentioned everything but there were no higher manager with whom i can have a word in was put on hold. I was having a conversation with one lady she tried to help me out but she suggested me call tomorrow morning. Refund or adjustment can be happened if I called before today 11:55pm. Second day When I called was treated by Mr Abhishek and shiksha in very nice manner.  Hat's off guys. They have noted my complaint and ensured that they will given resulation as early as possible.

Spicejet please make a note of my mistake as listed below:- 

1. It was my fault to call customer care where I got different depart timing of my flight departure. (I was informed that time to time timings status was getting changed.. ridiculous)
2. It was my mistake to ask your ground crew staff to show the way. 
3. It was my mistake to choose spice jet inspite of other airlines. 
4. It was my mistake when your staff did not understand my time value. 
5. It was my mistake I was treated differ from other (fully partiality)
6. It was my mistake to show the ticket to police who did not understand my name on the ticket. 
7. It was my mistake that your airline timeing is getting changed time to time. 
8. When your staff stated that all are my mistake. They are right everywhere I accepted and admitted.
9. It was my mistake that I was not shouting and was remain calm. 
10. It was my mistake I was kept on hold around half and hour to connect with executive but no one help me out. 
11. Overall very pathetic and nightmare experience I had first time with spicejet airlines.
12. It was my mistake that your counter crew members don't have idea to try their best in difficult situations. 
13. Becouse of your staff conduct I had to paid ola couple of times. 

I am appalled by this incident and request you to investigate this matter further and take necessary action against those responsible.

2nd day service issue 
I had a connecting flight on 6th when I reached to Delhi boarding terminal was different and I had to missed my flight again due to shortage of time. I was unable to reach from terminal 1 to terminal 3 with in the time 30 minutes. I don't know on what basis they have confirm my flight. It was a journey where I have seen full of flight was empty no passenger like spicejet services at all. When I missed my flight after that I have been to spicejet customer counter and requested for full refund of filthy and poor service. The representative of spicejet had confirmed that as of now he will refund the amount for Delhi to dharamshalla itinerary and Pune to Delhi flight he has made a note and will speak to hire management for full refund 😔😔😔 very bad service by them.

I have a stamped ticket where mentioned refund will be done with in 7 working days but now it's been 20 days there is no result and they marked my reservation under no sho
Feedback:- SpiceJet doesn't have a great track record when it comes to quality customer service.

Spicejet's Ruthless & Illegal Conduct and Worst Customer Service,Rohit,Chennai (Madras) - New Delhi,"I recently booked a ticket from Chennai to Delhi on 6th September 2023. But, sadly I had to encounter the worst experience with Spicejet, where I was denied onboarding on a mere request of writing only 2 words on the excess baggage receipt - ""Laptop Bag"" after payment of the excess baggage charges for the laptop bag that I was carrying. Such conduct from Spicejet was very unprofessional and dissatisfactory. When a customer pays the ticket price, he owns the right to travel through the flight and taking away this right is illegal in all terms. I can not understand if there is a policy of spicejet to charge amounts for a laptop bag, what made the team cancel my onboarding on the request of adding these 2 words - ""Laptop Bag"" on the excess baggage charge payment receipt. 

To my utmost surprise, when I raised this with Spicejet's escalation points, they are saying that I have only refused to travel and they did not deny onboarding. This is completely false, as any sensible person can vouch for it - if I would have to refuse travel I would not have even paid the excess baggage charges in the first instance. This is a pure betrayal from spicejet. Atleast, they should have the guts to accept what they did.

I then also went to google to check on the reviews of Spicejet where I found that many customers faced the similar issue where they were denied onboarding by Spicejet staff and then Spicejet later took their steps back to say they did not deny the onboarding.

Because of them I was left helpless but to book another flight late in that day. I had to reach Delhi urgently but because of Spicejet staff, this was unduly delayed. They have even refused to refund the ticket price.",Domestic,1.0,August 2023,22 September 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,1.0

Disheartening Experience - Unprofessional Staff and Unreasonable Charges,Raj T,Kozhikode - Dubai,"My recent journey with Spice Jet airline from Calicut to Dubai was a complete disappointment. The check-in process was marred by unprofessional behavior from the staff. We encountered an unfortunate experience with the staff, who displayed aggression and utter disrespect towards passengers.
Adding to the distress, the staff demanded an exorbitant additional charge for our luggage, including an unreasonable claim for my baby's stroller, which we had previously taken on the same route without any problems during our outbound flight. This inconsistency and unjustified charge left us deeply dissatisfied.
Despite providing proof of double payment, Spice Jet is yet to refund the excessive amount they charged us under duress. It is disheartening to see an airline of this stature failing to provide basic customer satisfaction.
I sincerely hope Spice Jet takes immediate action and thoroughly trains their staff to treat passengers with respect and empathy. As loyal customers, we expect a better travel experience and fair treatment.

Spice Jet - A bunch of thieves,kaynat s,Dubai - Ahmedabad,"Spice Jet is a bunch of crooks and fraudsters. We travelled from Dubai to Ahmedabad on 30th June 2023 and out of 5 checked in bags, we received only 4 at Ahmedabad airport. The ground officer wrote a complaint and said that there is nothing to worry as everyday 50-100 bags go missing. He said this so casually as if it was a joke.

Very disappointed we left from there and received a call after 2 days that the bag was found and would be delivered to our address. But shockingly when we checked the bag, many things were missing.

Since then, we have been following up with them but they hardly respond.  And now they came up saying that they have checked the CCTV, the bag was safely loaded from Dubai Airport in the same flight. So if it was in the same flight, why was it not loaded on the belt? They have no answer to this question as it is a clear case of theft. The bag was purposely held at Ahmedabad airport so that they could steal the imported stuff and return it to us 2 days later. We are international passengers so imagine the discomfort we had to go through as many important things were in the bag. We came to spend joyous summer vacation in India but this is the welcome we got, I request government authorities to take strict action as unethical behaviors like this may effect tourism in India.

Please check the reviews I have attached below and you will see that many passengers faced the similar issues. I wonder how the government did not take any action if so many reviews have been posted against them. The only regret is that I should have called the police at the airport instead of trusting them and leaving the airport.

Please guys be careful while booking your next flight with these fraudsters!! If missing bags is a normal thing for them, expect them to go to any level.",International,1.0,June 2023,24 August 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

They keep giving the same answer in emails as if the answerer doesn't even read my email.  They wrote in the beginning of the email that they apologize for the delay, then they said that they checked the cameras and they can't say where my things are lost because it is not clear on the cameras but they believed it can't be happen because pf CCTV, I ask myself how can I trust this company that after 25 days nobody give me a clear answer and the conformation that I'm asking from 25days.

The worst company that can ruin your trip Try to buy ticket from the other company with better responsabilità.,Sheida B,New Delhi - Srinagar,"We took a flight from Delhi to Srinagar, the flight was delayed, when we arrived my luggage did not arrive, there was no official to take responsibility for this.  Only one guy who didn't speak English gave us a receipt and said to call tomorrow.  The next day, no one answered our calls until they answered in the afternoon and said one suitcase has arrived, but we don't know if yours, come see,if it's yours?  We go to the airport and collect the luggage, BUT what happened? my things are lost.  My boots, jacket and trekking gear.  There is no one to follow up on the situation, two boys who have no command of English observe our wandering in silence. One they way of back the guy who call Ashish gave his number to us to follow up.on the first day, he answered and said that he will call us until the evening, but he did not. On the second day, he answered our call and said that he would follow up and call us, but he did not answer. On the third day, I realized that he had blocked our number. 
Today, when I am writing this comment, 24 days have passed and I am trying more than 40 emails and calling different numbers more than 3 times a day.  No one is taking responsibility, I am not looking for my belongings because I believe that with this mess no one can find my items, but I am asking for a confirmation so that I can use my insurance.  Today is the 25th day that they gave a similar reply to my email, saying that I should have left my valuables in my handbag.  Yes, don't forget you have to carry your boots, jacket and trekking gear in hand luggage.  They have not even given me a confirmation for the luggage delay.  Our entire trip to Kashmir was ruined because of this company's irresponsibility.

Read this before you fly with them.,Fablu@cat,New Delhi - Leh,"Spice jet is the worst airline ive ever been. 

They are not trustworthy of handling luggages; first they did not inform me that my luggage were not on board with me even tho I check-in early and were at airport for more than an hour. 

When I got to destination they asked me to sign agreement to open my luggage cus there were ""restricted item"". The funny thing is, i flew spicejet just one day before this trip from Dharamshala to delhi - which they didnt detect there were any restricted item, i didnt even open my bag because if was just one night then i go to Leh.

However, they open my bag and search all my personal belongings which got really messy and dirty on my things (there were black stains like petrol or sth i cant even wash it off). My new backpack was also scratched and cut, the whole bag become super dirty and apparently not being handle with respect. 

*When i received my bag the second day, i ask them what have they took out and what kind of item i have that were restricted? The staff replies: e-cigerettes!

TOTAL LIAR, I DONT EVEN SMOKE!!!!!! ---- they didnt find anything, they just try to blame it on me for what is wrong for them! they didnt inform me my bag has problem --- if they delay my bag just bring back to me why do you need me to sign off that agreement and touch my personal things and get them so dirty and messy????????????????????? 

I am so frustrated and pissed with the way they handle this, please do not fly with them. If you search a little on google - just type spicejet and DGCA then you can see how sloppy they were on so many aspect. 

DGCA notes to Spicejet on Feb 2023: 

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had issued a notice to SpiceJet for “poor internal safety oversight and inadequate maintenance” that resulted in “degradation of safety margins”.

Fix the credit card swipe machine .,Tour34303018710,Chennai (Madras) - Madurai,There is a difference in the baggage limit on international and Domestic. I am aware of that.  I am a NRI and visiting India after 5 years. I have booked additional baggage but the rule regarding excess baggage was confusing in the website so I decided to pay during the check-in . Check in process started at 7:30 am. The staff mentioned I have to get additional package and pay more for excess. Total cost was 19500. I gave my travel credit card the same card used for booking. It is premium card and I can get back my luggage expenses. Unfortunately non of my credit cards go through. I called the bank and they said they didn’t receive any transactions. I did have enough rupee and I could pay using the website. The staff escorted me to arrival gate to the exchange and after lot of struggle and loss I got the money and paid . They whole process took 2 hours . Then the staff demanded me to show my pan card because it was cash transaction. Luckily I had the pan card with me in one of my luggage .I came home after 5 years and the check in process was not pleasant. I could be avoided if those credit card machine was working or able to do we checking and pay online. I lost so much money on the currency conversion and I can’t reimburse the baggage allowance because I didn’t use my card.  Staffs at Chennai airport were helpful.

delay in flights a constant feature,Ranjana Lobo,New Delhi - Jammu City,"I was travelling from Abu Dhabi to India for attending the funeral of my close aunt and unfortunately spice jet was showing online to be the only airline to travel on the domestic sector from Delhi to Jammu to reach in time for the final rites
Guess what at 5.30 am I received a sms that the flight is rescheduled and I rush to their counter at T3 ( next to Indigo, from where I actually bought my second ticket to reach home in time to see my aunt for the last time) , staff at the spice jet booth say sorry you can only checkout on the app or call the customer service 
As you would be aware that check-in has been made mandatory on domestic flights in India so one cannot opt out of it if one has to fly 
So I try on the app it gives me a technical error and says call customer service so at 5.40 am I am trying to find an alternative at the airport and also tried to check out of the flight and cancel but no luck
 
I sent a mail to customer care attaching their message on the app and they refused to refund saying to send us the call log to validate that I did call

"Worst ever flight, should avoid at all cost.",Neha N,Ahmedabad - Dubai,"I traveled on Spicejet flight no SG15 on AMD/DXB Route, and both my checked-in luggage bags have been damaged by their handling staff, we have got the damage report also from Dubai Airport, and made an official complaint to Spicejet via email.

They did promise us a refund of only INR 2,000/- (2 bags' combined value was around INR 16,000/- and both bags were brand new and purchased from Dubai), they asked us to submit the Bank Details so they can process the Refund, which we already did, but to date, we have not received anything.

As of today, in June 2023, it's almost 6 months, after giving repeated reminders on the refund that they have promised, but to date we have not received anything, and now they are not even replying to email.

And this is not the first time that we have received damaged baggage from SpiceJet, it has happened earlier as well, but that time I was new in Dubai, and not much aware of how we can claim the damage, so didn't make any complaints.

I would like to praise the cabin crew staff on the above mentioned flight. She was so helpful and nature was so humble and friendly with all the passengers.

The name of the cabin crew is Ms. Shilpi Sharma, i was sitting all the way behind on my seat no. 21 C and randomly, I noticed her because of her continous attentiveness and politeness towards all the pessengers, The humble way to insist passangers to wear there seat belts and water requirement.

Not only her perfect way of working, but her dressing up of uniform, and Mask were also perfectly put up.

Despite, the flight was completely packed up and having Just 2 crews, Her Continous prompt actions of serving to the passengers were so perfect, And by seeing her dedciation towards her work, got me to put up an appreciation mail for your team. Really team like these, make a far step further then travelling with any other reputated airlines.

Even the second Crew treated so well and served perfectly to all the pessengers.

Want to thank your entire team for making my journey so comfortable and safe.

I do regularly fly and will surely fly in my coming times with spice jet.

Date 4th June 2023
Passenger – 2 Adults (Me and my wife) + 1 child (5-year-old sone)

I booked same 10 days back on 18th May, early to save cost for direct flight (2 hours 40 mins, now you suddenly cancel and asking to travel with connecting flights (12 to 14 hours travel)
Why should I waste such time because of your fault. I will not let you guys save your money by these fraud activities by cancelling direct flights and asking to travel with connecting flight. 
My allegation - Flight company is making fool to passengers and making their money by cancelling direct flight and asking passenger to travel with connecting flights.
I need my refund plus 10,000/- as compensation to book another company direct flight. I’ll escalate at maximum level on daily basis till I get this resolution.
Are you guys going into the category of GO FIRST.
I talk to 2 customer executives Nandini and Abhishek Kumar for almost 30 mins to get same resolution, but they were not able to provide and last option which I tell them on recoded line that I’ll escalate at maximum level I can.

The flight was delayed from scheduled 23.30 hrs on 21st May to 00.45 AM on 22nd May. We have landed on T2 terminal at 4.20 AM.

We have lost sleep, money and an entire of work day pre travel and post travel. We have barely slept. They have offered a sandwich and Rajma Chawl at the airport. It is a hardship which we will never forget and not recommend spicejet airline to anyone.

The leg space between chair is extremely low. An average height person like us was hitting knee to the seat ahead. Extremely bad experience both ways. There was no courtesy shown to us by spicejet ground staff and cabin crew. Just a customary apology was given.

We will never recommend Spicejet airlines to anyone. If there was a zero star or negative star to rate, would have picked it to rate the service.",Domestic,1.0,May 2023,21 May 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

However, this review meant for my  recent travelling experience with Spice Jet (SG-869).

They were always ready to assist with any query or any concerns of matter that faced by the passenger on board which making me feel valued and comfortable. Moreover, they were so proactive through their gesture that you can say, they were one step ahead beyond customer and cabin crews’ official relation boundaries.

The Interior design of spice Jet is very decorative, the seats were spacious and economically designed. In addition to, the cabin was very clean and well maintained which created a pleasant atmosphere. Apart from that, The Jet have hold In-flight Magazine through which you can gain your perspective plan into the pursuit of unknown places.

The flights adhered to schedule, ensuing on time departures and arrivals.  This reliability provided peace of mind and allowed me to plan my next travel with ease and I greatly appreciated their commitment to valuing their passenger time.

In conclusion, I want to personally give thanks to all four-cabin member, specially to Ms RIMI. She hold exude grace and charm carrying personality herself with poise & sophistication like other attendants of Spice Jet.

Excellent support from Ground Staff,Anil Narasimha,Bagdogra - Bengaluru,"I would like to take a moment to express my utmost appreciation and gratitude towards the outstanding service provided by the ground staff members of SpiceJet, Anuka Goshal, and Rajkumar. Their assistance during a stressful situation at the Siliguri airport truly exceeded all expectations and deserves recognition. My wife and I found ourselves caught in a dreadful traffic jam in Siliguri, which resulted in a significant delay in reaching the airport. With only 30 minutes left for our flight's departure, we were understandably anxious and worried about making it on time. However, as soon as we arrived at the airport, Anuka and Rajkumar ensured that our check-in and security process went smoothly and efficiently. Despite the time constraint and the pressure they were under, Anuka and Rajkumar displayed remarkable professionalism and composure. They handled our check-in baggage swiftly, ensuring that we didn't have to worry about any extra delays. Moreover, they guided us through the security check process, making sure we complied with all necessary procedures without wasting any time. Their willingness to go above and beyond to assist us during a challenging situation was truly commendable. Their friendly and reassuring demeanor helped alleviate our stress and made us feel valued as customers. It was evident that they genuinely cared about our well-being and ensured that we didn't miss our flight.

Not only did Anuka and Rajkumar demonstrate exceptional efficiency and professionalism, but they also showcased their excellent problem-solving skills. They remained calm and composed, quickly adapting to the circumstances and finding solutions to any potential obstacles that arose. Their dedication and commitment to customer service are truly praiseworthy. Despite the time pressure, they didn't compromise on the quality of their assistance. Their attention to detail and thoroughness were evident throughout the entire process, leaving us with a lasting positive impression. 

SpiceJet should be proud to have such exceptional employees representing their brand. Anuka and Rajkumar's outstanding service has left a lasting impression on me, and I will not hesitate to recommend SpiceJet to others based on my experience with them.",Domestic,2.0,May 2023,14 May 2023,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0

The flight was just over 2 hours and the seat by then with the small legroom had become quite uncomfortable (I’m 1.85m tall)

After enquiring at the Spice Jet desk I was informed  that my luggage has not been boarded because of the detection of some inflammable liquid which I was not informed priorly during checking. Even I can assure from my end that my luggage doesn't consist ofvamy such items.
Then I was told that my luggage will be sent by the next flight scheduled at 12.p.m. But it's been long that I have received any further information regarding this matter which is really a very  unprofessional and unacceptable from such a reputed aviation company like Spice jet.

While baggage formality, I was carrying 21 kg total and laptop bag extra with me. Spicejet people asked me to have only 15 kg + 7 kg seperately including laptop and and my personal handbag. But i dont understand what was issue with them they were targetting me to pay them more because of extra kg. One person told me to pay 1000 rs for 1 kg and other person said 600 rs for 1 kg. It means they were just catching me for money. I removed almost everything from my luggage and then it shown 21 kg in their machine. They are the big liers because i checked the weights of my luggage at home which was absolutely correct at home. And look at indigo service they consider my handbag and laptop bag also to bring it to cabin.

Also spicejet flights are very compact, literally ghutan hoti hai andar and We pay almost same money what indigo demands, they have good luxurious planes with good amount of space and they dont trouble also for the baggage. Extremely bad experience with spicejet in terms of plane space and baggage formality, i will never prefer to travel in spicejet in future.

Flight cancellation by spice Jet airlines,chotinita,New Delhi - Khajuraho,"We booked two seats on Spice Jet for the flight to Khajuraho on 19th April 2023. We were flying to New Delhi from abroad, to land in Delhi in the morning of  19th April. Our plan was to start a two week tour of Madhya Pradesh and another state, then return home. Hotels, guides, safaris, further flights were booked and paid for. On 17th April,in the evening,  I logged in to web check-in, and found to my great concern that spice Jet had booked me for a flight to Khajuraho on 20th April instead. When I called their office, I was told the flight for 19th April had been cancelled and passengers had been booked for 20th April instead! Without their knowledge or permission!!! I called my travel agent, he told me this was a common occurrence with Spice Jet they had a tendency to suddenly cancel flights when they felt the flight was inadequately full, and they were known for this impudent behaviour towards the customer. Just what did they think I was to do with a whole day  and night spent at Delhi airport, at no notice?  What about the disruption to my other plans for my holiday? I wrote to them, they refunded the cost of the ticket, refused to compensate for other costs incurred-- I had to book a very costly flight at short notice to another city, then book a taxi to drive me for 6-hours to Khajuraho. The problem was  that only Spice Jet flew on 19th April in the afternoon to Khajuraho, certainly they were aware of that. Otherwise I would have been most reluctant to book with them.

Terrible customer services,hippytravelling,Dharamsala - New Delhi,"I am really disappointed with this airline. I had to change my flight because I didn't realise the distance between the terminals was so great and could have missed my international flight because of this. I contacted spice jet to amend the flight and spent over an hour speaking with one of their officers because it wasn't made clear what their policies are. The website said you could amend for free in the first 24 hours,  what it doesn't say is that there are hidden charges included. I asked to speak with a supervisor but the operative made it very clear that she didn't want that to happen. After a long pointless discussion I managed to speak to the supervisor and she was less helpful than the officer. I ended up with no flight and a loss of 3000 rupees.

worst people of airlines,Reanato,Mumbai - Bagdogra,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the way your staff treated us during our recent experience with your airline. On 4th April, six of us had a scheduled flight from Mumbai to bagdugra at 1 pm. Due to heavy traffic on the road, we were unfortunately delayed in check in time by just 10 minutes which had departure time after 50 minutes of our arrival.
However, instead of showing any compassion or understanding towards our situation, your staff members were extremely rude and unhelpful. They refused to let us board the flight, even though we explained the circumstances of our delay and begged them to reconsider. To our utter shock and dismay, they insisted that our tickets were wasted and that we had to purchase new ones for a later flight.

This was a huge inconvenience for all six of us, as we were not only forced to reschedule our plans but also incurred a significant financial loss due to having to buy new tickets for 50 thousand INR. It is extremely unfair and unjust that six passengers had to suffer just because we were delayed by a mere 10 minutes. Moreover, it is disheartening to see that your airline does not prioritize customer satisfaction and instead treats passengers with such disrespect and contempt.

We expect a prompt and appropriate response from your customer service team regarding this matter. We hope that your airline takes necessary measures to ensure that such incidents do not happen in the future, and that passengers are treated with the respect and care that they deserve.",Domestic,1.0,April 2023,6 April 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The worst flight I ever had,Mel-Mat,Dubai - Kozhikode,"I have been flying for almost two decades by different airlines but I had the worst customer experience as well as scheduling experience by a flight company - Spicejet- last week.
I was at the airport around 10am for 12.55pm flight and was advised it's rescheduled for next day 12.15am. I had come travelling by 4 flights and it was the last phase of my trip. I had no where to go as I had already checked out of the hotel and waiting in the airport. The time was rescheduled several times since then and finally took off only after 2am. I checked with the staff but no support or meal coupon was offered. However in the flight I came to know atleast 4 co-passengers were offered free entry to the lounge and had meals as they ""fought"" for it ... but I didn't know how to fight. 
The worst experience was when I asked for a Form -D for immigration purpose. The ground staff didn't know what it was but were helpful  in checking and confirmed it's available in the flight but when I asked the flight staff, at first she didn't get what it was and then straight away said ""it's not our responsibility"" in a very rude way. I tried to explain what the ground staff informed me but she was not willing to listen but started to stair at me as if I did a crime by asking for it. I told her that I can't stand her attitude and turned my face. After the meals were served, I asked if I could have another juice but the same staff told she already gave me a ""complementary"" drink. I mentioned that I paid for the meals and how come the drink that comes with it becomes ""complementary"". She seemed very agitated and started shouting ""did I do anything wrong to you"" three times. I saw her colleague was trying to calm her down and I prayed and kept my temper and turned my face.

"Late again, slightly better than outbound flight, but never fly with SpiceJet again",David D,Goa - Mumbai,"Tuesday 28th February and we were booked to travel on SpiceJet flight SG 454 from Dabolim Airport, Goa to Mumbai.

We were due to depart at 13.05 arriving at 14.20, at Terminal 2, a scheduled flight time of one hour and fifteen minutes.

We were able to check in online just under forty-eight hours before departure and            e-boarding cards were issued. It is a mandatory requirement to check-in prior to departure.

We did receive a call and text from the Airline the day before our departure advising us that the flight was delayed until 14.50. While this was not the best news, at least we were aware and able to reschedule our taxi pick up.

When we checked in at the airport, the information board showed a departure time of 14.50 but the status showed that the flight was delayed. This changed to 15.15 at some stage.

We eventually started boarding the flight at 15.03 which completed by 15.30, it was a slow laborious process.

The aircraft pushed back from the Terminal at 15.38 and was finally airborne at 15.51, which was an hour later than the rescheduled departure time.

As we borded we were handed a small of water. During an announcement we were advised that the flight time would be an hour.

Shortly after take-off the crew passed the cabin distributing food to those passengers that had pre-ordered it. They also offered other passengers the opportunity to purchase snacks and soft drinks.
A couple of plus points, the cabin was clean and the legroom was not bad at all. It looked like a reasonably new aircraft, Boeing 737 Max8. However,  it was freezing cold in the cabin despite wearing a hooded top.

We landed 16.51 with a good bang on the breaks. The aircraft came to a halt at a spot on the tarmac at 16.58, from there we were bussed to the terminal where we arrived at 17.18. We picked up our cases at 17.30.

We landed two and a half hours later than our original scheduled landing.

Before landing the captain made an announcement apologised for the delay, supposedly due to technical difficulties. This was a bit incredulous as every SpiceJet flight due to depart today, from Goa, was delayed some as late as seven hours. Definitely an airline to be avoided
The name of the aircraft was Green Chili, in keeping with the Spice theme.

Fraud on excess bag policy,saurabh,Dubai - New Delhi,"I had a flight from Dubai to Delhi on 1st March 2023,  There were 2 passengers on same PNR. I have multiple complaints for this flight.

1) We had a total limit of 60 kg check in and we actually checked in approx 52 Kgs of weight and we had 21 kg of weight for the cabin.  During airplane boarding, I was charged 420 AED for an extra 7 kg of weight. At the time of check in, I was not told that there will be a charge at the gate for that extra 7 kg weight. If you had clearly communicated this during baggage drop, I would have adjusted my extra 7 kg. There is a complete lack of communication from spicejet end. Even though I was within the allowed total weight limit , I was charged an extra 420 AED. What happens next is even more bizarre. After taking 420 AED at the boarding gate, the spicejet executive took 1 of my bags (equal to 7 Kg) from me and took it to check-in. So, i was not even allowed to take excees 7 Kg from the Cabin.Long story short, My total checking bags were 59 Kg and my cabin bags were 14 kg. (Both within limits) and I was charged 420 AED.

2) My apathy does not stop here, There is more. I have received one of my checked-in bags as broken. 

3) Well, my apathy does not stop here, During the booking, I was charged 3 times for booking and I had sent an email to ask for a refund of two charges. I am waiting for a response on that email for 2 weeks. They are so fast to collect money from customer fraudulently and so slow on refunding customer money.

It was literally can understand that only due to cast and religion that supervisor behaved in that manner because that boy standing aside and doing his work ,suddenly he came snd started to shout, that boy saying ""Sir nothing happend then why you are shouting"" but he is contiously shouting at him using bad words . very very bad..

SPICEJET IS THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE AND PATHETIC AIRLINES IN OUR COUNTRY.,Shamani Tendulkar,Mumbai - Dharamsala,"On 24th February 2023, I had to travel to Dharamshala  for which I had booked Spicejet Airlines which was going to fly Dharamshala via Delhi, having a 2hr45min layover at Delhi Airport (PNR QEZ8FG). On 21st February 23, I was intimated by Spicejet that my flight was rescheduled and inspite of knowing that I was a single woman traveling with a 3year boy, they had put me on a combination of flight which required a stayover at Delhi Airport to catch next day 6.55 am flight to Dharamshala. Later considering my request I was put on 25th Feruary flight. On 24th Feb itself the flight got rescheduled twice because of which my layover at Delhi Airport got reduced to 1hour. The Spicejet staff at Delhi Airport was JUST HORRIBLE, they literally made me and my son run at the airport, to exit from terminal 3, take bus and rush to terminal 1 to board the flight to Dharamshala, the staff was horribly rude and inconsiderate. My Baby couldn't run along and when I requested the Spicejet staff to help me carry my bag, for me to hold my son, my request was bluntly denied. After reaching  Dharamshala, I didn't receive my bags, after checking with the staff, I was been told that they have forgotten my bags at Delhi Airport, and that I will receive them next day itself. I was feeling so helpless that I literally started crying at the airport, I had no clothes for me and my son, no winter wear and most importantly my baby's food, since he is allergic to few food ingredients, I always carry homemade ready to cook food suitable for him. That whole day till 10am next morning I had to deprive my son off his daily food. Next day the bags which we received were also damaged. This experience with  SPICEJET has caused severe mental agony and trauma to me and my 3year old son. Spicejet has absolutely ruined this precious trip for me and my son. I really wonder why SPICEJET has appointed such useless staff Ms. Meenu Thapa and Ms. Devyani Singh at Dharamshala Airport, they had nothing to say apart from ""Sorry, hum kuch nahi kar sakte"". I thought in India it would be easy for a single mother to travel with a child, but travelling by SPICEJET IS THE WORST NIGHTMARE one can ever experience.",Domestic,1.0,February 2023,27 February 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Worst experience in my very first SpiceJet experience,Sasha,Dubai - Mumbai,"So, I took a flight form dubai to mumbai. Never take the SpiceJet flight  guys. So I had 20 Kg extra of two passengers to carry the checkin baggage. But I didn’t bother since I had exactly 7k as handbagge. You won’t believe cut two what happened when I got to the boarding gate. They started weighing everything from your purse to your laptop to your hang baggage. For gods sake it will come above since we have chargers and battery packs and laptops with us. They asked me to pay 8000 Indian rupees can you believe that???? When I asked them check my baggage online it’s not even 60 Kg for two passengers so why can’t you adjust or bring me the bag I will put the stuff in my Check-in since I have so much space there. They dint agree and the manager of Spice Jet at boarding gate at Dubai airport threatens me to deplane me. I just can’t believe what kind of hospitality training has be done to speak to the  passenger in that manner. I am never going to fly cheap SpiceJet airlines ever in my life.

Horrible Experience. Our Bags were left in Dubai,Siddharth Chaudhary,Dubai - Mumbai,"We flew Dubai from Mumbai on 1st Feb flight number SG 14, PNR - UDPHUJ. On arrival at Mumbai 0630 hrs and after waiting for 45 min for our luggage, we were informed that our 6 bags were off-loaded in Dubai itself. We were not alone, there were 20-30 passengers who did not get their bag. The person who was giving the information was extremely rude when passengers asked for the reason for missing bags.  Instead of responding to the concerns of passengers, he kept on arguing with them. 
We were then give some forms to fill with bags description, house address, contact details etc. We were told that bags will be delivered within a day. We waited for 2 days and did not get any call, no one answered the calls at airport. We had to send a family family to the airport . We had business travel so we couldn't go ourselves. In the form, this person was authorised to collect the bags on our behalf. 
The family member had to wait at the airport for 3 hours and was told there is only 1 bag out of 6 bags has been identified. Rest of the bags were untraceable. 1 bag we got was broken. The staff was completely ignorant our concerns and continue to misbehave with the family member when asked why the bags are taking so much longer. 
We again went to the airport next day to collect the remaining 5 bags and this process again took 2 hrs. 
So much of harassment is completely unacceptable.

The journey turned out to be so hectic and made us so upset since we had to rush to the airport to catch a flight from Pune to nagpur that too double the price and then from there to jabalpur by train. So please think twice before you decide to travel by spicejet atleast between these cities where there are only few direct flights that also from spicejet.

WORST EXPERIENCE WITH AN AIRLINE,Tani,Dubai - Mumbai,"I was supposed to be flying out from Dubai to Mumbai on the 18th of December. My flight was initially booked for the 13th of December, however on the 11th of December I made the change in my flight ticket on the Spice Jet website to fly on the 18th of December. I have a credit card charge to confirm this change as well. I checked on the Spice Jet website on the 17th and it said that the flight is on the 13th of December, however I had already PAID for a change in this flight. 
I had to be in Mumbai for some important family issues and the only thing the agents kept telling me was that there's nothing they could do. When I asked for a manager or supervisor they had every excuse available, from no supervisor would be able to help me, to there's no one in the office, to anything they could to keep me from getting on the phone with some sort of manager or supervisor or anyone. I had to buy another ticket last minute and spend a lot of money on a flight. 
When I initially called Spice Jet and spoke to the customer care executive, she said all I would have to do is write an email and you would refund me the money right away. I have been calling Spice Jet almost every single day and all I have been hearing is that it is coming, then someone said that Spice Jet has issued a refund but they can't tell me the amount, then someone else said that they assured me in 24 hours I would get a response to my email saying that I would get a refund but then when I called back they said oh no wait for 72 hours. Every single time I waited, I never got a single response. I have had to call back and explain the situation EVERY single time. They have consistently refused to give any sort of solution to this issue. They've been giving me the run around for 2 months now, and I still haven't gotten anything. 
This is the first time I flew with Spice Jet but I can say with conviction I will NEVER work with Spice Jet again. 
There was not even any communication from Spice Jet regarding this supposed no-show. If someone had contacted me, even sent me an email about this, then at least I would have 5 days to get some sort of solution before I had to fly.

Shweta Goswami - extremely Rude vindictive and unprofessional  staff at Bangalore airport counter,Ashish,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"Dear SpiceJet management,

This is to complaint against Shweta Goswami, who is  such an arrogant, vindictive and unprofessional staff at the Bengaluru airport 

One dreads having to go to the SpiceJet counter and boarding gate seeing her for fear of her misbehaving and talking rudely for simple things such as reprint of boarding pass on one occasion or for seat allocation 

She will talk rudely and when you tell her to be nice she takes revenge by cancelling boarding pass and reissuing with a center seat right at the back 

Like for my 18C confirmed reservation she canceled the boarding pass and reissued with seat 29E just to take revenge and show her arrogance with a sly grin 

This is not the first time and have encountered and witnessed the same behaviour with others during my travel at Bengaluru 
Even today she was arguing with a SpiceJet staff who was on the same flight threatening her that she will put her on the next flight 

management  really need to either send her for comm skills training or relocate her to some other duty which doesn’t involve customer handling 

Definitely not the kind of staff anyone   would want 

PLEASE take action

Scam company,lorenzo s,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bangkok,"I’m travelling from several months and 40 days ago I arrived in India. After one month on mainland and the last week spent on Andamans Islands, today I had a flight from Port Blair to Kolkata and a connection flight from Kolkata to Bangkok.
Once arrived in Port Blair Airport, the employees told me that, not having an immigration office there, I had to take my backpack in Kolkata and check-in again.
Fine.

Arrived in Kolkata and collected my bag at 13.45, I move to SpiceJet desk for the Check-in the flight for Bangkok (SG43) scheduled for h15.45

After a long wait in queue, the guy at the desk (you can check the employees’name from my boarding pass issuing time) communicate me that if I would enter in Thailand, I should need to have and show them the Hotel reservation, Health insurance statement and a confirmed flight out of Thailand in one month.
I was pretty sure that having an Italian Passport, I didn’t need a VISA for Thailand (up to 45 days) and I tried to explain this to your desk-employee.
His answer was just: 
‘even for Italians is mandatory!’
I asked him several times if he was sure, but he was inamovable.

So I said ‘ok let’s check-me in and if I’ll need, I’ll buy a flight ticket at the Visa-office in Bangkok’ 
No way, the clerk didn’t want to let me get the flight without the required documents.

At 14.45, with the plane leaving soon, I found my self in the senseless situation to buy an useless flight from Bangkok to Vientiane (that I would never use as I will continue my travel by land to Laos and then to Vietnam) just in order to take my plane for Bangkok!

A few hours ago I arrived in Suvarnabhumi Airport and at the Passport control gate, the girl simply told me ‘No Sir, you don’t need anything. As per Italians citizens, you’ve 45-days visa free’ …

after many emails, customer service continues to apologize for the delay of the flight…. no refund, no communication from management even in Cc. embarrassing non-management of the problem and indeed, general ignorance, beyond stupidity

They rescheduled my flight to February 10 without my consent, and when I asked for a refund, they deducted Rs. 1000 from it. Moreover, their customer service is also the worst. The attendant was very rude, and I told him that I would raise a complaint and tweet whatever you are saying. He replied, ""Do whatever you want."" Is this the behaviour a customer should expect from Spicejet Authority?
Instead of paying an extra amount because I now have to purchase a ticket from a different airline at a high price, Spicejet deducted Rs 1,000 from the refund.",Domestic,1.0,February 2023,3 February 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

After having spoken to the senior staff , we came to know that the flight is yet to depart to Leh and after it returns from Leh , the same flight will go to Jaisalmer.

Thee funniest part was that the ground staff or spicejet did not have a Plan B …

Never again,David D,Mumbai - Goa,"Thursday 26th January and we were booked to travel on board SpiceJet flight SG455 from Mumbai to Dabolim in Goa.

It was scheduled to depart at 15.05 and arriving at 16.30, an hour and twenty-five minute flight.

The departure time suited us as we we due to land in Mumbai, from Heathrow at 11.00 which gave us some leeway.

The day before our departure we received notification that due to operational difficulties our flight would not be departing until 18.30. At this point we were given the opportunity to request a refund or rebook another flight. 

We took the opportunity to book another flight, as it happens the flight due to depart at 11.15, SG 488, was delayed until 14.40. Later on during the day we received another notification  of a further delay until 15.15.

When we checked in at Mumbai, we were still scheduled to depart at 15.15, so all was looking good. However later on an additional delay was announced until 16.25 which was revised again to 16.05 and then 16.15.

Finally an aircraft turned up at 15.50 which we commenced boarding at 16.05 which was completed 16.30. The aircraft pushed back at 17.00 and was finally airborne at 17.20.

We were seated by the emergency exit, extra space seats. The extra cost of our seats included a chicken junglee or veg sandwich and a soft drink.

The captain did make a rather rambling announcement, don't know if it was an attempt at humour but it went over our heads. He made reference to the married men's club, flying carpets and regretted having to leave our ears to look after a trainee pilot. All very weird and at times not really appropriate. He did inform us that the flying time down to Goa would be 50 minutes. He also regretted any inconvenience caused by the delay.

The Crew did what they had to do, all a bit robotic. Must say that the cabin was clean. 

There was a child a few rows back that screamed virtually the entire flight adding to the misery of the experience.

We landed at 18.10 with a smack on brakes.

The name of the aircraft was Pri Pri, a reference to spice.",Domestic,1.0,January 2023,27 January 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

This airline has literally no respect for a passenger's time or money, with their consistent delays. 0 accomodations made by the airline staff. No refreshments provided either. And no alternative same day flights were provided. Even the airline staff were saying it was the worst mistake of their life joining their role, so you can get a sense of the state of the airline. This flight was supposed to reach Pune at 4:15 PM but due to delays, is now started to arrive at 1:15 AM. If I wanted to travel alone late at night, I'd book my flight accordingly. And even though they are providing refunds, it is useless because booking a same day flight with another airline independently is obviously going to be super expensive. They don't have any tie-up's with other airlines so they can't accomodate in alternative airline flights. and obviously nobody would want to have tie-up's with such terrible and unreliable airlines.

Dont trust and book Spice Jet. Worst ever Airlines!!,Sachin G,Durgapur - Dubai,"Booked tickets for my 75 year old parents coming to Dubai (for a family function) as connection time was less and bought an expensive flight!!

At durgapur checkin counter spicejet staff informed that they dont have full system in Durgapur and my old parents have to collect luggage at Mumbai and rebook. A big inefficiency of spice jet. We had no choice but to accept. 

Then the departure flight got delayed which got cancelled. Reason “operational”.

After war like situation my parents managed to get following day flight. They had to travel back home to neighboring city 100km away again in taxi after collecting luggage back. Total time wasted 6 hours, strength and total Harressment.

On same day at 11:30 pm india time we were informed that again following flight is delayed and only option for my parents is to take early morning to Mumbai which means they have to wait for 10-12 hours at Mumbai airport. They have made a joke out of it. They are not ready to provide solution or any compensation. They are totally stubborn!!

The counter lady Trisha Banerjee said there is no other option. Either wait for 10-12 hours in Mumbai or cancel the flight. 

When i insisted to talk to senior spoke to Nitesh Kumar Senior Executive. He was same as the counter lady. 

There is no senior management in Spice Jet!!

Its a shame i bought tickets on spice jet and went through such a bad experience. Its late nite and no resolution!! For sure my parents will not be able to attend the family function in Dubai!!

NOT ALLOWED TO BOARD SPICEJET FLIGHT No SG242 Kolkata to Mumbai,Nitasha,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Mumbai,"I was refused entry in to the Spice Jet flight no SG 242, 9th December, despite having bought the ticket through Trip.com. I have a receipt of this purchase and confirmation that my booking was successful. 

When I checked in to the flight a boarding pass was issued to me of a completely different flight, which I did not want to take or had paid for.

At the boarding gate, I was refused entry saying I did not show up in Spice Jet's system. My attempts at showing my ticket and receipt were met with rude remarks and I was blamed for having an incorrect boarding pass - obviously the boarding pass is created by the system and not hand written by me!

Now, because of this miscommunication, I missed my flight and a very important meeting in Mumbai. Also your airline staff, in particular one lady at Kolkata airport was extremely rude and refused to provide support or further information. I was asked to sit down and ""forget about this flight.""

I would like to file a complain against this particular person, please let me know if there is a specific procedure for doing so. I obviously don't wish to name them on a public forum, but please let me know the procedure for filling a complaint for harassment. 

Finally, I have now bought a brand new ticket with INDIGO, which cost me GBP 177.47 - unnecessary expense that I didn't need to pay. Not to mention the panic, insult and desperation this situation cased. 

Please can you look in to the matter and refund me the full amount, with compensation, as soon as possible. I have also reached out via email to custrelations@spicejet.com

"If there was negative marking, I would give that",Mouli Paul,Pune - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Spicejet still remains at its worst. Late flights, no refund of cancellations. There was one time when I had booked a meal and my money was paid online. However, I didn't receive the meal on flight as they said it was not showing in their records. After escalation of the matter, I never received the refund. My fathers flight to Dubai was cancelled by Spicejet and he never received the refund. This time, unfortunately I had to book Spicejet again as it seemed reasonable. Although I always prefer Indigo over anything. 3 hours before the flight, I received a message saying that it's delayed by 55mins. As the boarding time approached I went near the gate only to learn that it has been further delayed by 45mins. The attendant was oversmart at her best asking people not to shout and behave.

Won't let you web-checkin without paying money and will stress you out with invalid information,AM,Bengaluru - Pune,"Happened multiple times with Spice Jet
There are many options to pay for a seat as part of a bundle or to choose a paid seat. Alternately there's ""Auto Web-Checkin"", which claims that it will email your boarding pass 12 hrs before departure. But no email comes. They claim over phone that there are no charges for web-checkin at the airport, or assistance to checkin, but their rules clearly state that there is a Rs200 charge for assistance with checkin or boarding pass. They have also wasted my time at the checkin counter to run out the clock so that the mandatory web-checkin which is only allowed 2hrs before departure time is not possible any more. They still will not assist you at the checkin counter seemingly busy, so you are left waiting in stress regarding the ticking clock reaching closer to boarding and departure times, and you are still outside the secure area. At that point the options become limited and the traveler gets frantic and pays whatever is required at that point to try to pay for a seat and checkin on their mobile device. This has happened to me more than once now, so I imagine that this is a way for them to penalize travelers who try to book the supposedly advertised fares without paying the extra for the seats, which appear optional, but isn't really.",Domestic,1.0,December 2022,7 December 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0

"Worst experience with Spice Jet*** PNR- KYM3YC ,SG 327",Parash Sharma,Bengaluru - Bagdogra,"I had booked a ticket for my dad (Age 64) PNR- KYM3YC from BLR-IXB for 13/11/2022. He is an old man and uses hearing aids too and I thought Spice would care for him when he is travelling but my expectation was upside down.

Here are the series of events:

Priority Check in

The ticket says priority check in. But when my dad asked for it, Spice ground staff denied it and asked him to stand in a long queue which took more than an hour.

Check in Process:

His baggage was checked in and the ground staff said the weight is good. Then ground staff decided to weigh the hand baggage of my mom and dad and told them that they are carrying excess hand baggage.

ground staff saw that he is old and can be robbed as he is paying cash. Then spicejet staff asks for Rs 6000/- which my dad paid and they give him a handwritten receipt which doesn't have details of weight , tax etc. Shouldn’t we get a printed receipt with the details?

Then I got a text that an excess of 5kgs was charged Rs 3000/- . Shouldn’t I get the message of Rs 6000/- if it was genuinely charged? It's clear that ground staff took extra cash and it's a clear indication of robbing the passenger (senior citizen).

When asked for clarification your ground staff was rude and denied to provide any sort of clarification.

I kept on writing to SpiceJet Nodal officer, Blr manager, customer relations, social media team and I get generic responses saying we will check and get back. They are checking since 13 nov and they haven't got back to me with answers.

Poor experience,Sahil S,Dubai - New Delhi,"Took the flight from Dubai to Delhi. They WILL weigh all your carry-ons + laptop bag AT the gate (note: NOT weighed or even reminded about this at check-in) and they WILL make you pay at the boarding gate for each kg over 7 kg. I could have easily moved items from my carry-on to my checked-in luggage (which was 10+ kg under the max allowance). Myself, along with  10+ passengers complained about not being reminded about the rule at the time of check-in. They were all made to pay. In the end, the whole thing seemed deliberate, and hence, like a money making practice. I noticed poor management and upkeep as well. For example, the airline double booked my seat to me and another person. When we brought this to the in-flight crew's attention, the in-flight crew assigned me another seat because luckily, the flight was not full. Moreover, my seat belt was tied the wrong way.

Horrible customer service. Never pay with international credit cards. You may never see any refund. Flight gets delayed.,Shamir,Dhaka City - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I have been frustratingly dealing with them about a simple refund for over 6 months without any result.

I used the same credit card to book my flight and select preferred seats. However, the seat selection didn't properly go through online but they charged me. This happened twice. The first time I called them, they told me it'll take 10 days to issue the refund. I waited 10 business days but there was no movement from their side. I called them again, had to tell them the same story again and they asked me to wait for 5 more days. I waited but nothing happened. Then I called them again and repeated the story. This time, they 'formally' registered a complaint by taking every minute details about the transactions manually and told me it'll take them 2-3 days to issue the refund. I waited for 5 more days. In the meantime, I received an email from their customer service team asking me about the same details that I gave them over the phone. I called them again asking what was going on and they said that they were having internal communication issues between their departments. I had to provide all of those details again. They promised that I won't have to provide them via email anymore. However, my perils didn't end here.

After a couple of days, I got a follow up email from them asking me to provide those details over the email again. And this went on for days. At one point, I got fed up and started telling them to read the email thread carefully every time. It's the same answer over and over again. That they are looking into it and my issue is their utmost concern.

Eventually, I lost hope and let it go. Now after 6 months, I sent them a reply again asking for an status update. For the last 4 months, they made zero communication and are acting as if nothing happened.

I read now multiple stories similar to mine, but I can support the claims of theft from Spicejet staff. 

We were made forcefully to check-in our locked hand luggage in Durgapur Airport.
When arriving at the Mumbai Airport, my luggage arrived without the lock. I therefore instantly checked the content of the luggage. 
Valuable items have been stolen and the staff went thoroughly through all my luggage.

Neither the airline nor the airport did respond. I have flying experience in multiple continents and countries, this is the first experience of this sort.

Worst staff with zero customer satisfaction on top of having delayed flights,Traveller,New Delhi - Srinagar,"I was traveling from Delhi to Srinagar on 07.10.2022 with Spicejet. I was carrying one piece of checked - in luggage, one piece of cabin luggage with a laptop bag.

I had done web check - in well in advance, yet NO BOARDING PASS was mailed to me. While the passengers are completing timely proceedings from their end, Spicejet fails to do their part on time. 

I came well advance in time and was checking in my luggage. The lady at the counter weighed my checked - in luggage. She also insisted to weigh to my cabin luggage and Laptop bag as well. A practice which was not equally applied to all passengers but only to me. 

Why did the lady at thr counter all of a sudden wanted to scrutinise my luggage only and not care to check other passengers? This is a airline that works on whims and carelessness. No rule is uniform and they pick and choose passengers to harass them just for fun. Beware of booking your flight with this airline, you might be their next target. 

The lady told me that I had extra luggage. As she weighed my laptop bag, she said that is the only piece of luggage allowed. Thought it is clearly mentioned on their website and ticket that one piece of cabin luggage and one laptop is allowed. She dismissed all that and began harassing me. She said that for that extra piece of luggage, I had to pay Rs. 7050. 

Looting passengers is their new form of income. Probably they are struggling so much they have stooped so low they think they can harass common people for fun. I told her I will return my luggage as someone was waiting outside the airport. She had the rudest tone possible and informed me that counter will close in 40 minutes. 

I know what trouble I had to go through with CISF to return my luggage. When I finally checked-in and past my security checks and I was waiting at the Boarding gate, this shameless airline had the audacity to announce that they are running 40 minutes late. I repeat 40 minutes late. 

The kind of rush they created for me after harassing me and demanding money for a luggage which other passengers were allowed to carry. It was pure mental harassment for me. I would never ever recommend this airline at any cost. They lack the most instincts of humanity.

When Spicejet was late who was taking responsibility for that? No one. 
Who was answerable? No one.

Very positive experience and a thank you massage to ground staff at that time.,Tirath F,New Delhi - Rajkot,"On 14/10/2022 we had flight from Kathmandu to delhi and then delhi to rajkot. The Kathmandu to delhi flight (Nepal airline) as schedule was supposed to reach Delhi airport Terminal 3 at 2:35PM IST but, due to delay flight reached at delhi terminal 3 gate at between 4:30-4:35PM. The departure time of our spicejet flight(SG3755) from Delhi Terminal 1D was at 5:35PM. So, we had only 1hour for completing immigration> baggage claim > travel from terminal 3 to 1D > spicejet cheak in > security > boarding. Delhi immigration helped us a lot due to that we reached at terminal 1D at 5:10-5:15PM. We were 7 people and upon requesting spicejet ground staff allow us to board the flight even though cheak in was closed. 

We are very thankful for the ground staff as well as manegement of that flight and and spicejet. If i had chance to personally thank them... I will thank them personally because they helped us to save approx 70k-90k INR ( cost of rebooking the flight and hotel for night for 7 people).

Suddenly few staffs came and told us to weight all our hand luggage too. And he instructed that not spare even a gram of weight to them . We had some food packets and some almonds which we bought in kashmir. Our luggage was not more than 4 kg excess from all 5 passengers. We told it's only 800 gms excess in hand . And our checkin luggage is accurate . They started saying  aggressively  to weight our hand purse and kids hand bags and food packets aslo. We requested them it's very unhuman act to do so with person flying with kids . But they claimed they will charge us 9 kgs . We told how could one charge for jackets in hand, food packets and hand purse of ladies. Looking to them we understood that they were waiting for only excess luggage charge and have no concern for flight delay. We finally have to pay 5400 rupees and then they again at boarding gate started staring to us.  We told we have already paid 5400 now what else you want . Do you want to rob us then take a pistol and put on our head and take everything from us . Many Public also suffered same thing and when they saw public has started opposing they went way. After getting into flight we were inside the flight for 65 mins on the run way . Flight did not take off. After all public strated shouting and loosing patience finally flight was takeoff and we reached Delhi .

Considering I was to attend a relatives father's death ceremony on 15th morning I booked the 7.20 pm flight. Little did I realize that my misery had begun. While checking in they told the flight is delayed. We had not received any prior notice. The ground staff kept us in the loop and telling us that the flight is delayed due to bad weather. From bad weather the reasons changed to cleaning etc. When the pilots arrived they revealed the plane had not landed. The girls at the counter were extremely rude. If you don't believe you can check fact that she once shouted at her fellow colleague which was extremely inappropriate behaviour especially in front of passenger. Our flight took off at 11.00 and during all these while we were not offered even a glass of water. How pathetic can you get?

Money taken by booking website but no tickets issued -> still not solved 6 months later,David O,New Delhi - Bagdogra,"Sadly this is the 3rd update of my review...

In March 2022, I tried to order tickets for a flight from Delhi to Gangtok Pakyong Airport (I have indicated another airport as the destination in this review because TripAdvisor does not seem to know Pakyong Airport). At the time SpiceJet was my only viable option to fly to Gangtok. The SpiceJet website malfunctioned and no ticket was issued. I tried a few times with 2 different credit cards but nothing worked. I noticed later that money was taken from my credit cards.

The error message shown in their booking website stated that in such case the money would automatically be refunded within 7 working days but of course that didn't happen.   I have contacted SpiceJet customer service about this but all they have done so far is tell me that the issue was forwarded to the relevant department where it would get priority treatment. Those words turned out to be just hollow empty promises, nothing was done. I was able to recover the money that was taken from my Belgian VISA card after submitting a dispute claim to VISA. Due to different time limits I could not do the same for my French VISA card unfortunately so there I needed to rely on SpiceJet customer support. But they have been absolutely useless so far.

What is more: I am actually in India for the moment where I have had the opportunity over the past week to travel with other Indian airlines such as IndiGo and Vistara. I have had 0 problems with them, everything went smoothly (including the booking online and payment with foreign credit card). With SpiceJet on the other hand, I have had nothing but problems.

Would give 0/5 rating if I could.  SpiceJet customer support has all the details of my case (PNR No. : IJEJSR / SIJLPH / T8W38F)",Domestic,1.0,March 2022,16 September 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Flight from Pune to Dubai was OK, still could not book online or from any of the Self Check In Kiosk, also was very surprised when they served water in an open cup instead of serving in small sealed bottles like all airlines are doing, every frequent travelers knows not to drink airline water which is served in a open cup.
During the boarding again it was chaos, no announcement, only one ground staff shouting on top of this lungs to around 200 passengers, who are not listening. Finally after some shouting he was able to control the crowd.

Nightmare of an Airline !!!,SolivagantWolf,Pune - Bengaluru,"SpiceJet Airways E873PV
Well I don't know where to begin had a awful experience with their App. Could not do Web checkIn at all used website, what'sApp nothing . Send them countless  emails and only got response saying will get back to you within 48 to 72 hrs. My flight was within 48 hrs. Send email to their customer service and only got an link which was not helpful at all. So my only option was to go to the airport early possibility to book using Self CheckIn Kiosk. So went early to the airport and guess what the Self CheckIn kiosk has all the other airline icons except Spice Jet. Why am I not surprised!!! OK so waited for the counters to open and when I went to  checkin my luggage the staff tells me that there is only middle seat available no aisle or window. Now for a guy like me who is 6'3"" and heavily build middle seat is not an option so she is trying her very best to sell me the exit seats with leg room which comes with some benefits and finally since I don't want to sit in the middle opted to purchase it for additional INR 1400. At the boarding gate NO announcement was made every one was huddled to board, I had one ask the ground staff and showed her the boarding pass then only she allowed priority boarding to me. Flight left at 09:36 hours. Took off from runway A11 L9 smooth take off. Well the complimentary meal was a complete disappoint was thinking would be getting a proper tray meal instead got a sandwich, which could be described and tasted like boiled shredded chicken slapped between two stale bread. The juice RAW MIXED BERRY tasted like concentrated sugar syrup.

Complaint for Pune Airport Staff member,Fearless54753431018,Pune - Jabalpur,"Pune Airport Staff - Arrogant, lack of courtesy , we have read somewhere that ticket wont be charged for infants so we didnt book but Mr. Dinesh Goswami( pune airport spicejet counter staff) literally fought and said aapka bachha ro rha hai to hum ky kare when we requested him to get the ticket for infant fast.
My grand ma passed away , it was really urgent for us to take the flight but they didnt allow and moreover every staff was enjoying this Tamasha,
We cried a lot due to their behaviour and we were expecting support from them but they cleverly thrown us out of the airport.
No one helped , we spent around 17000 rs .
Spice jet is neither ready to reschedule nor refunding my money back.
Since we have no other options so it becomes very difficult situation for us to travel by spice jet

SPICEJET - HARROWING EXPERIENCE,Rajeev Joshi,New Delhi - Nashik,"My wife and myself were booked onto economy on SG8363 from Delhi to Nasik travel on 7th. August 2022. Booking was done on Jul 21 2022 with ETD 5.00 pm.
Spice jet - roller coaster started the very next day when I get SMS that the flight is rescheduled to with ETD of 07.55 am. Since we were going on pilgrimage trip had to make all the necessary changes to hotel conveyance etc. We did not have any choice as the Spice jet was the only flight supposedly to leave in the evening.
Day before travel I checked in printed boarding passes with seta no.'s 1A & 1C (priority Check in). As mentioned on revised ticket and boarding passes my flight was scheduled to leave from T3 at 07.55 am.
I was pleasantly surprised when in evening prior to my travel I got a message from cab service supposedly managed by spice jet offering drop service to T3 and they seemed to have all my travel details. I immediately opted for this service although it was expensive compared to Uber, as I thought that they would be more dependable. Taxi reached well intimate on the date of travel but it was a small hatchback contrary to Seadn which was booked by me due to luggage. But with a few calls (and since cab had come before time), the cab was changed as per my need.
We reached T3, was allowed by security at the date after seeing my ticket. Just as I was about to drop the luggage at the counter (online check in was already done), I was told that my flight is from T1.
I rushed to the SpiceJet counter at T3, and the lady there confirmed that the flight is from T1. When I showed her the ticket and boarding pass mentioning T3, she said it was changed the previous day and SMS was sent to all passengers. On my countering that I had not received SMS and they have confirmed such critical information by making a call...she brazenly said ""You did not book ticket from our site, why did you go to travel agent"". She further created panic, telling me that now it will not be possible for me to take the flight and i would miss it.
Now, getting out from the airport again was arduous task, with the security personnel asking me to come in a queue...she also got mad at me when I insisted that i need to go out quickly to try and catch the flight from T1. After lot requests and cajoling by my wife the security relented and we rushed out.
As soon as we cam out a private taxi guy approached us (apparently he seemed to be waiting for us...smells of connivance.
The taxi driver charged us Rs. 1050/- for driving us from T3 to T1 all the way assuring us ""Do not worry, I will make sure you will not miss your flight), seemed more positive than the SpiceJet staff.
Our agony did not end their..on reaching T1 as we tried to enter the security personnel did not allow us saying that our flight was from T3...I told him that I have come from T3 and the SpiceJet has confirmed that the flight has been shifted from T1, he rechecked and told me that they do not have any such information.
I again approached SpiceJet counter only to be greeted by a very calm and casual lady saying ""No problem sir, actually flight number has also changed to SG9363. I will give you a fresh ticket"" Obviously, it was noir problem sitting behind the counter munching her breakfast and sipping Tea or Coffee.
Finally we managed to drop in the luggage and we rushed to the boarding gate...we were immediately taken to the flight on the bus. Surprised to see a very small flight, we were feeling relieved at least we got the flight. Even boarded, we realised that the seats allotted to us were 1A & 2B...tried to change with co-passengers but cannot blame them for their adamancy as little or no help was coming from SpiceJet.
Reached Nasik and vowed NEVER to think of travelling on Spice jet.
Sharing this to make fellow travellers aware of what might be on store fro you... TRAVEL ON SPICEJET BUT PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SERVICE THEY ARE TOTALLY INSENSITIVE TO PASSENGER TRAVAILS. 
Foot Note: We paid Rs. 15694/-, to get this experience and yes this included Rs. 2998/- as seat charge for Priority Seats.

Poor Customer Service. Luggage bag missing and broken!!,Donna Pilapil,New Delhi - Dubai,"Worst airline I can say, first flight was one hour delayed (good thing they informed via text message) the problem is we have total of 6 luggage bags. 12th August at around 9:40pm arrived in DXB airport with one missing bag after waiting, searching and checking the entire area of about 2 hrs, and finally DNATA made a report for our missing luggage bag. With flight PNR# -QY926P, flight SG 005. Today, 13th of August, my husband picked up the missing luggage bag in dxb airport as SpiceJet does not deliver it to your address provided in the report (so useless/none sense giving your address)and take note. It’s broken!!! The handle was broken. 

I will not recommend SpiceJet to any of my friends and relatives. Very hassle as we traveled with infant and my mother in law which is a senior citizen nobody wanted to help in a timely manner. 

The agent from customer service has lack of listening and sympathy with the client. His name is “hashid/harshid” something like that. 

The email provided for  the complain will have the Auto reply for so many time. 

No update from SpiceJet and DNATA as informed they will update us within 24hours. You have to call DNATA and wait on hold for 30 mins for the agent to answer the call.

HORRIBLE SERVICE -,Dolreich F,Mumbai - Goa,"I booked a flight from Mumbai to Goa on 7 July 2022. I don’t know what happened but after the Booking was completed somehow it was not the flights I wanted. I cancelled my booking immediately after that by calling their customer service and I was assured my refund would be credited to my account in 10-14 working days (I don’t remember what they promised).

I eventually rebooked my flights on another airline.

It is now almost 2 months and I have not received my refund.

I have called 3 times to follow up my refund.

1. They promised it would be made on priority and I would receive the money in 72 hours. A week passed nothing happened.
2. I called yesterday (10 Aug) they said payment has been initiated. Today is 11 Aug and I have not received any payment.
3. I called them again they said it will take 7-10 working days.
4. I requested their Operator to lodge a complaint (Complaint No: 10107890)
5. I am still awaiting my refund after 2 months of waiting and after having called them 3 times

The most horrible part is the long wait time of almost 20-25 minutes for their Customer Service to answer your call.

I would never ever book a ticket or fly Spicejet and I would caution others if deciding to choose Spicejet.

In this day and age of e commerce / online transactions one would have expected better service. 

I wonder if the owner’s of Spice Jet know the kind of service they are offering their customers.

Time to move on and change your old ways and be responsive and use digital tools to enhance customer service.

Worst Flight Experience of all time My Last time flying in Spicejet Especially International,Manu Ahuja,Dubai - New Delhi,"Generally, when you take an Upgraded package you may feel Little Special, Spicejet sells the SpiceMAX but right from Check in to Boarding to the flight experience nothing was maxed and I think I wasted my money with this airline. Generally, we can carry 7 kg Hand luggage with a Laptop bag and for ladies one LAdies bag and Hang luggage. Still, with them, they are taking weight at the boarding gate and even the stuff you purchase from Duty-Free they also assume that in that weight and then charging a ridiculous amount for excess luggage. They should inform the same at check-in luggage so that we can somehow accommodate that in Check-in Luggage but this is how they are earning money i think we all should avoid these airlines and book other airlines like Air India and Emirates, Even FLy Dubai is better

Not good experience with spicejet,Shadab,Amritsar - Patna,"And once again very pathetic experience with spice jet..booked to and fro tickets in spicejet being the only option from Amritsar to Patna as non stop flight... definitely have gone for indigo if there is option of direct non stop flight....and to the expectation, the day I have to travel ..I kept on receiving message of delay and delay..anyhow it got delay by 2 hours 15 mins but got my nerves up and down thinking it might get cancelled as in earlier case it is already happened with me with the same spice jet...
And now comes the message of return flight, they have rescheduled that flight after 2 days..is it a joke ( delaying flight by 2 days)...and the worst is yet to come....I kept on calling on spice jet provided two toll-free nos and I was in queue for almost between 15-25 mins on phone and it never connected... finally it got connected on the 3rd day after waiting in queue for more than 16-17 mins and then i told them to cancel my flight from Patna to Amritsar as I have made my mind if spice jet is the only direct flight option from Patna to Amritsar, I will change my destination city as chandigarh with INDIGO. And now waiting for my refund,hope it will rec on time...

NEVER USE SPICEJET. THEY HOLD YOUR MONEY. WORST AIRLINE.,DSA,Mangalore - Dubai,"My complaint no :09910584 
I have been waiting for 50 days for my refund. All I get is an email template  response our team is working on. I have given all the transaction evidence still they are ignoring and not refunding my money. I have also contacted the bank and they confirmed that payment has been successful. This airline is a fraud, scam, cheating customers by not refunding money. One of the customer care told me that there is a technical problem on their system since the delay. Oh really? How can backend service be down with technical issues within 50 days?

This is the email in response I receive every time. NOTHING ELSE. This does not help me in any way by getting my money back. I will keep posting negative reviews everywhere until I get a refund.

SpiceJet fraud alert,Vandita Sharma,Leh - New Delhi,"SpiceJet Fraud Alert
	1.	I had booked my flight from Leh to Delhi at 07.55 am from Leh airport. We reached the airport at 7 am and I did web checkin before. They closed the luggage counter at 6.55 am and when I requested them to do something about they ignored me and no one was not even helping me. When I missed my flight they told me that my flight was overbooked so they closed the luggage counter before time. I have a question from SpiceJet that why are they taking overbooking when they can’t board all the travellers in the same flight?? 
	2.	Not only this they told me to wait for next flight which was at 10.10 am in the morning. Similar situation happened with other customers as well. There was a group of 7 people who came for 10.10 am flight and they arrived 1.15 hours before flight time. Again they said that we can’t board 7 people only 5 can go and we will adjust rest two. They didn’t even allow us to fly in 10.10 am flight. After that they talked to GoFirst member and make the rest of two to pay 11000/ person (approx) and booked a ticked in GoFirst flight.
	3.	Again they told us to wait for 12.20 pm flight which we did because we had to reach at our place. In the end we had to reschedule our flight next day because they didn’t allow us to travel in any of the flight. Again a family with 3 member came and they told the same thing to them that the luggage counter is closed. They closed the counter 1.30 hours before flight time. When they got panic just like me, they went to their office and told them to do something. But again they were not paying attention to them. Also , they told them the same excuse of overbooking. When his father requested them that his daughter has an exam tomorrow they told that only a single person can go. Others will have to take another flight for which they will have to pay again.
My only question to SpiceJet is why are they taking more bookings when they can’t make their customers fly from their flight? You can take bookings as per your flight seats. Why are you making money by making people fool? 
Our hotel manager also told that most of the travellers face the same issue in Leh.",Domestic,1.0,June 2022,13 June 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"3rd class airline, misbehaved ground staff, rude and ill mannered cabin crew!",Gulshan,Mumbai - Chennai (Madras),"I booked my flight tickets with this pathetic airlines and that decision to choose SpiceJet turned out to be the nightmare! First and foremost, the airline added a stop (Jabalpur) at the last moment without seeking any consent from the traveller. I booked my flight for 8th June 2022, non-stop from Mumbai to Chennai. Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldn’t take a 5 hours since the unprofessional airline- SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option, I had to shift my journey date to 9th June.
Reached airport and there started another another round of drama.Ill mannered, rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wife’s health, the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health.
Me, my wife and my 3 year old son- we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time, that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement. At last, I had to request my fellow passengers to change the seats (they were kind enough to accept my request).
Highly unprofessional, rude and arrogant cabin crew: I went to washroom and at the same time captain announced about a brief air turbulence. The moment I came out of the washroom, the air hostess started shouting and yelling at me infront of my family. I was shocked to find her so angry and frustrated.
On 9th June 2022, I vowed not to ever choose SpiceJet. I have even raised this issue with DGCA.

Mental agony by spicejet airlines,Dr mamta arora,Amritsar - Jaipur,"I had my neice's wedding in jaipur on  26th& 27th  April.
Convience is what a person requires the most when (s)he is traveling and for the purpose of convience i paid extra not marginally but exceptionally. 
I booked return tickets for direct flight from Amritsar to Jaipur with spice jet owing to their good reputation for me and my family. ( which they failed upon miserably)
To my utter shock, a day prior to the scheduled flight the flight got cancelled and despite paying extra I was left with nothing. 
I tried calling spice jet customer service, but to no avail. No one even bothered to connect or talk on call. 
Being left with no other option I had to book even more expensive ticket at the last moment (last moment tickets are super expensive).

The refund I received had cancellation charges but Why am I liable to even bear the cancellation charges at the first place. 

Somehow, I managed to reach jaipur and attended the wedding. 

Upon checking for return tickets the only available direct flight was from spice jet. My family insisted to not book tickets with spice jet but for the purpose of convience and having faith in such a reputed company i booked tickets with spice jet. 
But again to my utter shock, a day prior to the scheduled departure again the flight got cancelled causing due hardship to me and my family. 
I faced mental agony despite paying INR 72,000/-.

Im a doctor by professional and i cannot leave my patients unattended. I've a a commitment towards them so i had to reach back on my scheduled time. 
Now without trusting any airlines,   I booked a cab for me my family and had to travel back in cab in this heat which generally takes 12-13 hours. 
I reached back on 
But the failure on the part of spice jet has not only caused monetory loss but has caused due hardship and mental agony to me and my family. 

It was the biggest nightmare and i would suggest everyone to never rely on Spice Jet.

Spice Jet staff so rude and unhelpful! Avoid them if you can!,Harpreet,Amritsar - Dubai,"My mum was meant to be transiting through Dubai on her way back from India to the UK. She is a UK resident. When she travelled from here (UK) she got a transit visa on arrival in Dubai. 

On her way back we thought it would be easier if we got the visa before she leaves as it would mean less hassle in Dubai obtaining visa on arrival.

The Dubai immigration got my mums date of birth wrong on her visa, we got the visa one day prior to departure and I phoned them so many times asking to correct the date of birth and they said it would not be an issue and would be sorted when she gets to Dubai airport.

Spice jet didn’t let my mum board the flight regardless of the fact it was the Dubai immigrations mistake and they said they would fix it and also she could obtain a visa on arrival. We begged them and explained this was an admin error and the Indian immigration was helpful after checking all her other docs and they let us to go to board the flight but Spice jet didn’t listen to us at all. They asked my mum to get off the flight and she lost over £2000 by missing two flights because of them, from Amritsar to Dubai and Dubai to the UK.

Their customer service is absolutely shocking!! They are not knowledgeable at all, UK residents can obtain visa on arrival in Dubai but they won’t listen to me.

"Hurtful, shameless",Sakina Husain,Mumbai - Chennai (Madras),"So this happened to us as well.

Our SpiceJet Mumbai to Chennai flight was preponed by 14 hours without any kind of intimation. It is only when our multiple attempts at web check-in failed that we realised that our flight was changed from SG 251 to SG 611 and it had already departed.

The SpiceJet counter at the Mumbai airport denied any help, saying that since it was booked via the third party Happyfares, it is their responsibility to inform the customers about any change in flight schedule.

I've thoroughly searched my mail box as well as the SMS, and also the spam folder, I haven't recieved any message regarding the flight, from both SpiceJet and Happyfares. However ironically, my inbox is full of all kind of promotional messages from both the parties.

SpiceJet site doesn't have any option to process the complaint. The customer care number directs us to the 'Alexa' model saying that they are experiencing heavy call volumes.

Happyfares people attended the call and blatantly denied any responsibility.

Obviously we have lost our money on both way flights because we had to cancel our trip, and not to forget the hurt caused to us and our friend whose wedding we were going to attend at Chennai.",Domestic,1.0,April 2022,1 May 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Love the way you Serve..,Parshav Kataria,Jaipur - Amritsar,"Service is outstanding. I did two flights with SpiceJet and on both flights, cabin crew were super sweet, polite, friendly and helpful. The customer service provided by Muskan (at Jaipur) and she was excellent. It was a short flight from Jaipur to Amritsar. Even on a short flight, they gave a really nice light meal that some airlines don't. Special mention for Ms. Eshita(Cabin Crew), who warmly greeted me and my colleagues on board and kept watching our comfort during the flight. The plane was very clean and the restrooms were cleaned more often than pre-pandemic. Crew was also with face mask on. It was a real hard work which shows their tremendous commitment to their high standard service. Meals were served quickly and they gave us enough time to eat and then cleared up really well. Planes were at a nice temperature. Flights all departed on time and landed punctually or even early. Only the Cabin Crew with its dedication which will be missed.

Worst Flight Ever!,Sonal W,New Delhi - Goa,"OK so we booked Spicejet from New to Goa and Return. While going the flight was delayed by 3.5 hours. Upon reaching, one of ours bags dint arrive. After waiting for 1.5 hours at the airport, the bag was located at the Delhi airport and due to the airlines Negligence, it was not loaded. They assured, it will be delivered the same night but it was delivered the next day due to which we had to buy our personal belongings while on a leisure trip. 

While coming back, the boarding was on time but we were made to wait for 1 hour inside the flight without any air conditioning. They said ac will only work once the engine starts. Passengers were suffocating and were seen airing themselves with the help of brouchers kept inside the flight. 

Trains these days are much better than these cheap low cost airlines that even charge you if you want a seat next to each other. And try calling their customer care with a minimum of 45 mins wait!

Great experience,Kaustubh A,Varanasi - Mumbai,We had a long car journey on the way to the airport and my 8 year old daughter was car sick. As soon we boarded the aircraft she got nauseous and wanted to throw up. I asked the air hostess for an air sickness bag and tissues to which she offered me 3-4 bags and an entire box of tissues. Unfortunately my daughter had the worst flight experience ever throwing up atleast 7 times. But the air hostesses were kind enough to get us sickness bags and even offered me cut lime slices with water and enquired about my child's health from time to time. The air hostesses were kind enough to arrange for a wheelchair as we were departing the aircraft because my daughter was visibly too weak to walk.

Very Poor Experience,VishnuM,Dubai - Kozhikode,"The boarding process at Dubai airport was taxing and stressful. FOr starters, we had announcements going on for about 30 minutes stating that the boarding process would be orderly and on a row basis, 10 rows at a time starting from the back. When the boarding actually started, nothing..! No calls for people to board in an orderly manner, felt like being herded as cattle.
I understand when an airline has issues accomodating the cabin baggae and has to be moved with the checkin bags, but this was done in such a haphazard and nonsensical way. Travelling as a group of 5, we had 3 carry on bags between the 5 of us - all under 7 kgs). After being herded like cattle, I was asked to weigh my cabin baggage which I did and it came to under 5 kgs, the Rep then took my moms baggage and placed  it on the same scale and says you have exceeded the limit and only 1 bag is allowed!!!!!!!!????? WHYYY?? Per the ticket ALL 5 of us prchases each passenger is allowed a cabin baggage provided its within the limit right?? I obviously argued with him and he let us in... but hold on... after our tickets were checked and in the entrance bay to the aircraft we had SpiceJet reps saying ALL the cabin baggage slots were full and all bags need to checked in now... REALLY?? so if this was the case why not say it at the first check , not 2 mins before? again I was let through after a small argument with them. Once Inside the aircraft, lo and behold we had plenty of space for my baggages.. no issues whatsoever.

Worst fraudulent experience,Peeyush,Bengaluru - Jabalpur,"After my e boarding pass confirmation from Bangalore to jabalpur i booked spicejet cab from the link sent me by spice jet message. It says never miss your spicejet flight by spice cabs. But next morning no cab was there no details and no cancellation message was received. Due to this it took time to get local cab and any how reched 25 minutes before departure in the baggage corner and  but no executive was there to assist they were busy in their own talks. One indigo member helped me to get out of airport but no spice executive was free for this as well while there was no crowd in counter.
I tried to complaint against it but in customer care there is 72 hours responding time

Pathetic Experience. Dont even think about Spicejet.,Chirag A,Dehradun - Ahmedabad,"SPICE JET

Remember the name is enough to make you think twice before booking. After international flight in 2019 one more pathetic experience in 2022.

Dehradun-Delhi-Ahmedabad SG 3762 & SG 193. First the boarding staff asked me to take off 1 baggage as they said they had only 1 piece policy. Even though my both bags didnt had total 15 kgs as per their weight policy. On the other side when I was travelling Ahmedabad-Mumbai-Dehradun through Indigo, their staff said, ""Sir if its not important just drop off your another bag too in the luggage section.You ll be tored carrying here n there.""
This is the difference between Indigo & Spicejet. 

And the story doesnt end here. I am roaming around with my 7kg secondary bag on Delhi Airport for 6 hrs & at the time of boarding, they informed me to put that bag in luggage section again as they didnt had more space in cabin section. So at the end it went inside. So when is now 1 piece baggage policy? 

This is heights. Harassing people even after charging premium then other airlines. 
Will never ever recommend Spicejet to anybody. Be it Domestic. Be it International. 

No wonder why Indigo has more than 70% Indian domestic market & spicejet will be a history shortly just like Jet Airways. 👎🏻",Domestic,1.0,March 2022,2 April 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Bad checkin and baggage handling experience,Lalit J,Patna - Bengaluru,"First they treated us in very special way by only weighing only our hand baggage and not anyone else in checkin counter. Really discriminating!! Not sure what drives them to do so

Baggage handling was worst in my air travel experience.  My brand new 16k Samsonite trolly had dents, scratches and black stains all over. I travelled to USA and budget airlines in Nepal, never saw such baggage handling. 

While flying Spicejet, always tag you baggage as fragile, even it doesn't have any fragile item, because the luggage itself can be damaged by them

Then they sent me feedback email and the link is timing out!!

We couldn't pre-book our lunch because there was no supply left. Yet, from somewhere the on-board staff appeared with just three sandwiches and assuaged our hunger. While returning from Shirdi, we were a tad late to arrive at the airport; there was absolutely no fuss and, instead, we noticed an eagerness to assist us. However, there is an area they could not help us: we could not get seats together because the adjoining seat was a paid-for one. We travelled separately. The staff wringed their hands and apologized.

Luggage Check-in bag withheld- without any fault,Jivesh Anand,New Delhi - Goa,"I Jivesh Anand with family had traveled from Delhi to Goa on 15th March 2022, flight- SG 8171, PNR- G9Q7PC. Had an unexpected very bad traumatic experience with SPICEJET without any fault.

My luggage Check-in bag which had children's (including infant) clothing, my office laptop etc. was withheld at Delhi Airport, citing that it has 4 copras (coconuts) identified at level 4 checking. The searching and claiming activity at Goa wasted 3 hrs at the airport.

It was really challenging to deal with such a situation when I found that Goa staff of SPICEJET are not answerable and they were reluctant to share any authoritative credentials to speak to in this matter. After a long struggle, I could only sign the declaration and consent form for SPICEJET to open my bag and validate the objectionable item in person. I was intimated that the bag will reach Goa airport by 2200 hrs. Post this, we left the airport to our local destination.

I continuously tried to follow up with the SPICEJET team for the next 24 hrs and despite no fault from my side, struggled badly to connect with anyone from SPICEJET to speak to. No one from them cared to call me and update me on the further steps.

At night 2400 hrs, I received a call from one executive that your bag has been identified and will reach Goa tomorrow morning. The cited reason for withholding the bag was a misunderstanding of the laptop with lose battery. I iterated to them that this carrying of the laptop was suggested to me by the SPICE JET officials only at the boarding counters in Delhi, as it has an inbuilt battery (DELL- Latitude 3410) which is not objectionable.

I tried to inquire about the objection created due to the existence of coconut in the bag. They refused the existence of the coconuts and apologized.

I had to unnecessarily discuss in length, requesting the bag to be delivered at the residing hotel. Earlier they refused, however, confirmed after a detailed discussion on the matter with the new concerned person.

Further, the next day, I continuously struggled to contact SPICEJET team to receive my bag and nobody cared to contact me or guide me till 1400 hrs. It was difficult and very inconvenient for us all without that important luggage bag. They were reluctant to share even the driver details with whom I could coordinate.

Finally, I received my bag after 24 hrs of struggle with SPICEJET.

I will never suggest anyone to consider believing that such instances can not happen with you. Such misconduct which spoil your plan and roadmap can give you immense stress, worry and trauma, are totally unexpected in this serious profession and business.

Considering this experience with SPICEJET, I will never recommend for SPICEJET.",Domestic,2.0,March 2022,23 March 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Terrible experience. Charges exorbant amount for baggage.,Rachna,Pune - Goa,"I had a backpack, carry-on bag and large bag to check in. Shubangi at Pune airport made me check the carry-on bag and charged me 9250 rupees. She wouldn't allow me to fly with the carry-on bag despite the dimensions being appropriate, stating my backpack was too big and didn't count as a women's handbag (despite the fact that it fits under airplane seats). Online, they were charging 6250 for an additional bag but at the airport it's apparently 9250. The experience was terrible. Shubangi and the male placing my bags on the conveyer belt were laughing at me as I handed my credit card, which I felt was unprofessional behavior. To check my bag cost almost double the price of the flight. SpiceJet wants to make money off of you in every way possible and will look for anything to charge you extra. And it's impossible to do anything about it because otherwise they don't allow you on the flight. Terrible experience. First and only time I'll ever fly SpiceJet. Never again.

Worst experience !!,Nelly B,Amritsar - Dubai,"I would like to request everyone who want to travel with Spice Jet, THINK AGAIN or FIND ANOTHER Airline. Starting from their staff to their managers all are completely untrained and unprofessional. Last month I was due to fly with them from Amritsar to Dubai and reached airport 6 hours before and their staff member firstly refused my entry as my test results had expired. Well, their SMS said to carry RT-PCR report issued within 48 hours prior to departure and my report was issued only 24 hours prior to departure. In their language they meant that you need to have your sample taken within 48 hours.  

Anyways when we thought of ignoring this issue and finding a solution to it, my husband who was over the phone with me, quickly contacted the nearest lab to get the quickest RT-PCR done before the flight leaves. I took a cab with all my luggage from the Amritsar airport and sat within the facility till my results came back and again took all my luggage on the cab to the airport. This time they had another issue with me “How did I get the result soo soon”. I explained the manger Ajay Dutt that these days you can have express RT-PCR done from anywhere. In return he didn’t believe me and said I must be lying and that this result from the lab is fake.  

 
That’s it I just couldn’t believe the amount of pressure, anxiety and helpless I felt at that moment as they took my luggage off the conveyer belt. I had done the right thing but obviously they didn’t have enough training or knowledge to read the results. My husband rang the lab to complain of the result not being accepted at the airport and the manager at the lab asked to speak to the Airport staff member who believes this is fake. Ajay Dutt wouldn’t take my phone to talk to the manager of the lab and instead rang 50 other places to confirm if the express results are even possible. He kept telling me that he has confirmed from places and that this is not possible. 

After requesting him soo many times he finally rang the number of the lab I got my results from and spoke to the lab manager. He was explained that its genuine result as there is QR code which will confirm him that the result is from an ICMR approved lab and to not hassle me for this issue. IT IS NOT THE JOB OF AIRPORT STAFF TO DEEM A TEST RESULTS AS GENUINE OR FAKE, THEY NEED TO LOOK FOR THE QR CODE AND SCAN IT FOR ITS LEGITIMACY.  

He didn’t like what he heard and then hassled me for the visa for Dubai, I advised that I do not need a visa as my transit is only for 4 hours at the airport. He then asked me if I have a transit visa, ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Dubai doesn’t need a transit visa unless you are transiting for more than 24 hours, the whole world knows that. 

Finally, after consulting with other people he did let me go and this is where my journey of all the problems came to an end. I sat on the plane and promised myself that I will never ever fly with them again in future.",International,1.0,January 2022,11 February 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

You preponed ur flight according to your comfort then why we pay for that???????????? Ridiculous!!

Spice max issues,Rishwan Sathik,Sharjah - Madurai,"Dear Customer care

I booked a flight ticket two days back to travel from Sharjah to Madurai with my family of 4 traveller. Yesterday I received a call from Spicejet to Spice max. Initially I was not convinced later he explained me the benefits like Priority checkin, complementary meals, Extra leg. And later I upgraded my ticket with all my family to spice max by paying additional amount of around 8500 rupees

But today while I was checkin I dint see any spice max counter in sharjah airport. While I was asking customer service officer they told me they don’t have any special queue line for this. After the long conversation I was directed to counter and they checkin my baggage, during that time I am not aware of priority sticker which the customer agent dint put in my baggage.
Later

once I entered the flight I dint see any spice max seats like extra leg to sit comfortable. The traveller who is sitting next to me also booked this in Normal spice ticket. 
After that they provide me the food which is like cashew packets. While the customer agent calling me he asked me the options of chicken Briyani and veg meals. While I am asking this to air hostess she told me they don’t have any option like this for now. And my baggage also dint come first. So I am totally disappointed with spicejet now. And we dint bring any food and we expect to have lunch on flight.Last year 2021 January 17 I travelled my family of 4 with spicejet from dubai to Madurai. That time we had experience of 8 hours flight delay and I struggled a lot with my kids in airport 

The guy who sit infront of me also having same issues but luckily atleast he got the luggage baggage as priority as I noticed there was a sticker mentioned on his packages. Even I am the one received the luggage atlast which makes me more disappointed",International,1.0,January 2022,14 January 2022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

We had to bear bothway taxi charges, time & effort for the carelessness and irresponsible actions from the spice jet team.
The Next day again the flight was delayed by 2hrs 30 mins, My parents, 69 years old, had to wait at the airport without any food/ refreshments from the spice jet.
After reaching Cochin airport we received the luggage in such a pathetic condition that half of the bag was broken and we couldn't even open the lock to see what all items were missing from the bag as the lock was also damaged.

You will be surprised( at least I was) that spicejet fly on routes where no other airline are ( like Jaiselmer) .

I mean to say that, they were even more than what is required of the job. To be honest, i hadn't travelled through Spicejet for a long time and I had even heard certain disappointing tales from my friends.  But I must say, 10/10 allll the way.

I would like to mention, that the manner in which they executed the step-by-step, batch disembarking of the passengers, was really polite. In most cases, you would see the staff being very rude at that moment and personally I feel they can't be blamed at that particular point of time. 

In spite of all that, the staff on our flight did a wonderful, patient job.",Domestic,5.0,December 2021,31 December 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Memorable Experience on Spicejet on route to home!,Nitin N,New Delhi - Jodhpur,"Today I traveled from New Delhi to Jodhpur via SG2277. I was on seat 2B.

So far, I have had great experiences while on board Spicejet but today was extraordinary! 

Niharika the lead crew is fabulous!!

She not just took good care of me but of everyone else on this flight. She is a great example of how one can handle the passengers inspite of a delayed flight. Always smiling and making sure that we were all comfortable!

She even apologized a couple of times for the delay and I loved her humility! I also noticed that she has a unique way of greeting passengers when they enter the aircraft! 

She was great at handling the kids too! 

I wish Spicejet and Niharika best of luck and make many more passengers loyal to the company!

His zeal and attitude toward customer first really inspired me
I am happy to have met such a wonderful person today

Appreciation for Cabin Crew,Mahe Tanzeel,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Dear Spicejet & Trip Advisor Team,

I flew on SG 8253 (13/12/2021) from Delhi to Kolkata & this was one of my flights where i felt extremely safe admist Covid-19.

I travel all over world for my business trips on regular basis & everytime have a different inflight service & safety experience.
I thought to mention about this flight crew as it was extremely professional and i throughly enjoyed my journey. 

The service of the crew was great & on time and they were always present throughout the flight for the passengers be it serving water or helping senior citizens with there bags and making them feel safe and comfortable throughout the flight .

I always wonder how the crew can carry the PPE on them for long flights and follow all the safety precautions and handled them so efficiently. Each of them were wearing masks, gloves & faceshield during & after service which I have hardly seen any other airlines crew wearing it each and everytime I travel.

Kudos to all the crew members for doing their job with such dedication & enthusiasm & for making my flight experience memorable.

I somehow managed to get all the names of the crew and I'm extremely delighted to put this across that Mr.Mahe Tanzeel : very hard working and extremely kind person.
Ms.Lisha : very sweet and polite 
Ms.Alpana and Ms.Supriya who were working in the front cabin are also very good.

I would sincerely request to please pass my Regards to each and every crew of SG 8253. Hope to fly with you guys soon.

All the very best and do take care of Yourself.

Unexpected service,Sathishkumar,Chennai (Madras) - Hyderabad,"On 12th early morning traveled from Chennai to Hyderabad SG731, I have an doubt on whether their cabin crew are really happy working with spicejet.
Travel of nearly 1 hr. did not see even a single second that cabin crew carried a smiley face, non of them was smiling at all (They were wearing Mask- but again we can easily find a person smiling or not thru eye contact)

The way the talk with the customers not a great hospitality service at all example their was a person next row to me who's table tray was in open during landing a cabin crew lady said - CLOSE THE TABLE TRAY that's all the word she used with hard face to the customer. I feel that she could had said in better some professional way. .If I was in her place I would have said- excuse sir we are about to land in few minute requesting (or) would you mind to fold the tray or some other trained professional way.

I feel that they are in lack of service staff or lack of training or not paying a staff on time or something else.Luckily my returned flight was booked in different airlines. Its my personnel opinion that.s all.

Hospitality Service Industry is something whether you are happy or not, while on duty while in uniform you need to carry a smile face to the customers.

Sure will travel soon again and hoping to see a pleasant journey.

UNNECESSARY AND FREQUENT FLIGHT DELAYS AND OTHER ADDED HARASSMENT,Mr J,Bengaluru - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I, am a highly suffered customer of Spicejet Airlines want to make all aware of the horrifying customer service they provide. 
I availed a ticket from Spicejet airlines on behalf of the Managing Director of my company and faced a treacherous issue regarding the flight time as it delayed and hanged up for 2 hours 30mins and also the time frequently changed for 2 to 3 times in minutes and my sir missed a very important meeting with business delegates due to lack of time. 
This frequent change of flight time is just not acceptable and very much annoying for the customers with a busy schedule.
Calling SpiceJet customer care is a nightmare. The phone only rings or else is busy and we are not getting any support. Previously also in an international flight, my boss faced similar horrifying issues from their end. 
My objective of writing this review is to convey all reading this review as well as to the other innocent customers of SpiceJet and also to business communities making sure that they should not get fooled by the company in near future.
Please avoid their service as they will harass you in no time and also will put you in a horrifying state turning you helpless during urgency.
In a line, Spicejet doesn’t know how to honor the time of valuable customers they are only interested in siphoning money from customers with false promises.",Domestic,1.0,December 2021,8 December 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Very sorry state of affairs about customer response,Sanjiv Jani,Rajkot - Bagdogra,We wanted web check-in. On app as well as website we couldn't make it. All numbers given on ticket were switched off. I 'physically' had to rush to Rajkot airport to have a 'web' check-in! I sought on mail information on RTPCR test. The auto-reply said 'Will get back to you within 3 working days'. Who in the hell waits for three days to get an answer to such small issue? The airline staff of Bagdogra also cruelly handled my bag and broke the belts and wheels out of one bag.,Domestic,1.0,November 2021,16 November 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

In-flight experience - SG8103 (14 Nov 2021 crew) Delhi To Chennai,Anshuman K,New Delhi - Chennai (Madras),"I would like to bring to light the efforts of Miss. Muskaan(flight cohost/attendant) in making our flying time comfortable like at home. 
My family was impressed by the way she showed patience in helping an old age couple settling down in the flight. From their luggage to their comfort she was like the perfect host. Her dedication to the job and spirit to keep the comfort of the customer above all is commendable. My daughter, of 5 years of age, was very well taken care of. She was happy & all smiles on the children's day when Miss. Muskaan dealt with her. Even my wife felt respected & cared about. Muskaan's energy level all throughout the flying time was consistent and above par. Her patience, soft, caring & respectable approach makes us want to travel in Spicejet again with her being as one of the co-hosts. It was a wonderful experience in Spicejet after a long time.

Horrifying Experience. Not reliable airline for vacation planning,malini r,Jodhpur - Bengaluru,"We booked Spicejet for our return journey from Jodhpur to Bangalore on the 4th Nov 2021. As we had planned Jaisalmer trip for Diwali vacation, it was a good option to take 5.30pm flight back so that it gives us ample amount of time to travel from Jaisalmer to Jodhpur and 2hrs flight Journey. But we received an SMS at the airport just before boarding our onward flight to Jodhpur that the flight is cancelled. We are shocked and could not believe and we tried to reach the IVR. As you can expect, with 30mins on IVR we still could not reach anyone from spice jet customer care.

We had started looking for alternate flights for return and we were seeing double the fare and also longer duration of 7-10hr with stopovers. Our vacation had turned very unpleasant at the start itself thanks to Spice Jet.

So on landing at Jodhpur we headed to Spice jet ticket counter and started asking the reason for cancellation and demanded them to issue a return ticket for us. The front-end person was pretty much sticking to one sentence that ""there is nothing he can do.."" So we asked him to get the higher person and then came Mr Suryanarayan Murthy. He was giving us below 2 options 1. write a mail and get clarification and may be reimbursement. 2. Take the flight at 12pm from Jodhpur with stopover in Delhi and reach Bangalore midnight with 12hr layover.

We got really frustrated with the solutions he was giving us and with all heated argument we were telling him, we will not move until we get return tickets. But Mr Murthy later resorted saying you do not hold a chance as you have not read terms and conditions. I asked him ""do you read terms-conditions while booking the flight?""and he promptly said"" he reads""...I can only say such deceptive person can not serve people. 

Spicejet chose to cancel the flight as there were only 17 people who had booked. So bottomline is Spice jet is unreliable so you can book the flight and be ready to take the trauma if they cancel the flight for their so called operational reasons..On the contrary, Indigo flight on same day at 12.30pm took off with only 30-35 people on board.

Horrific experience,Amit S,Dubai - Ahmedabad,"On 31st Oct' 21, my son travelled from Dubai to Ahmedabad by SpiceJet Flight SG 717. His ticket had a scheduled departure at 02:00 from Terminal 1. Since he is quite young and not very used to of travelling alone, I had to accompany him up to the check-in procedure. We had planned to be at the Airport by 11:00 PM i.e. 3Hrs prior to the flight departure, as per the norms. But, since we had many bad experiences with Spice, due to the flight rescheduling & delays in the past, we tried checking the flight status before leaving for the Airport & were shocked to see the departure time as 00:30 Hrs. 
In a state of Panic, we rushed to the Airport to meet the preponed deadline, without my son even having his dinner. When we were almost there, we got a Text message from the Airline saying that your flight has been rescheduled and now it will be departing at 02:00 Hrs., which was the original time as per our Ticket.
Anyway, since we were already there, we proceeded towards the check-in counters only to witness a utterly chaotic scene. A complete mismanagement. No Spice staff was visible, only a few young boys from Dnata were desperately trying to manage the crowd. They had barricaded the entrance to the check-in area as hundreds of people, who believed the Flt. Time to be 00:30 Hrs., were already queued up in there for hours. For such a long que, only Three counters were operating, out of which one was Priority check-in only counter.
Outside the entrance, slowly instead of the length of the que, the number of queues started increasing and in no time, there were at least 7 – 8 queues & no one knew which is the right one. The Dnata boys, in spite of their best efforts, were totally unable to control the situation & were on the verge of breaking up.
On a world class Airport like DXB T1, one could never expect or imagine a scene like Howrah Railway station. But SpiceJet successfully created it. Finally, after almost Three and a half nightmarish hours, my son could do with his check-in procedure and proceed for the departure gates.
I hope someone from the Senior management in Spice gets to read this and takes a note and some remedial action, so as to save the mental and physical harassment of so many passengers.",International,1.0,October 2021,7 November 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A

The ground staff were helpful to bring him upto the ramp.

On board they lead him and ushered him to a better spot. There service was exemplary 

The spice girl (with no offense to them) who were darned with PPE seemed over their Red uniform..... They had a close resemblance of a Nurse... I not just go by  the appearance, but the kind enthusiastic spirit I would call them  Nightingales in Red uniform.

Worst experience - No empathy for customers,Divya,Chennai (Madras) - Mumbai,"I was travelling from Shiridi to Chennai alone. I was carrying baggage within the limits of 15 kg. But unfortunately I didn't have have a single bag, I had to put one little extra hand language for check in. But they insisted i pay 1000INR, else they wouldn't allow to board. In fact fellow passengers requested to allow. The fact that if you travel in groups you will allow 2 bags but if you travel alone you won't allow inspite of having below 15 kgs is atrocious. Spicejet could have very well made an exception case. It wasn't that everyone was putting their luggage for check in. If you want to extract money from customers without a logical reason, am lost for words. Please show some empathy to your customers. If you want to go by textbook rules, then please keep sending terms and conditions over email and text msg instead of advertisements. It was just one of a case, as such the weight was well within the limits. Finally i paid INR 1000.

Spice jet flight no. SG2974 one of the best travel ever,raksha_84,Goa - Ahmedabad,"The cabin crew was very warm and amazing hospitality was demonstrated. I was travelling from BLR to Ahd via Goa and spice jet has recklessly made 2hrs journey to 10hrs journey. I had a horrible flight of SG3233. But all that bad flight experience converted into an awesome one just because the way SG2974 cabin crew conducted themselves. Rahul was very coperative and patient and his subtle gestures of keeping passengers comfert as top priority should be recognised. For example he collected the empty bottles of water without waiting for stipulated trash collection time from passengers. Even though its a very small gesture but it reflects the keeness to treat passengers well and at most respect and integrity towards work. Keep up the good work SG2974 crew, you made a difference and converted bad experience to good.. Atleast for this mindfulness i will surely fly spice jet next time. Thank you for all that you guys do.

I do not wanted to get wet in rain and travel for approx 2.5 hours in this pandemic situation, Specially while you are traveling with your family to another state you will definitely not prefer to get sick you always perefer safe journey and after this all one of staff mr. Oliver i guess he asked for boarding pass and didn't allow to any one to enter in plan i understand your security policy but you should also understand our situation we are standing out side in rain with no umbrella. you have to find alternate way to prevent this kind of situation i will definitely not suggest any one to travel by spice jet because staff were rude and i do not know who gave a permission to them to shout on Travellers. very pathetic service by spice jet ground staff.

The name of the cabin crew is Ms. Angela, i was sitting all the way behind on my seat no. 19B and randomly, I noticed her because of her continous attentiveness and politeness towards all the pessengers, The humble way to insist passangers to wear there seat belts, masks and follow covid safety rules.

Not only her perfect way of working, but her dressing up of uniform, accessories,PPE kit and Mask were also perfectly put up.

Despite, the flight was completely packed up and having Just 2 crews, Her Continous prompt actions of serving to the passengers were so perfect, And by seeing her dedciation towards her work, got me to put up an appreciation mail for your team. Really team like these, make a far step further then travelling with any other reputated airlines.

Even the CCIC, Ms. Tarushka treated so well and served perfectly to all the pessengers.

Want to thank your entire team for making my journey so comfortable and safe during this pandemic.

I do regularly fly and will surely fly in my coming times with spice jet.

I was specially taken care of where my needs and health was constantly being enquired by the flight attendees. 

Then the moment I landed in Guwahati, the attendees called up ground staff to bring the wheel chair up to the cabin and from assisting me from acquiring my luggage from conveyor belt to passing through COVID test and dropping me off to when my family arrived to receive me.

I booked tickets 2 times within 4 days to Travel from Jaipur to Pine, but both times flight got cancelled or diverting route with one or other excuses at last moment, when you have no other choices. 2 hour journey take 10 hours after rescheduling & purpose of visit collapsed, even needs to be cancelled return flight also.
Once you book the ticket with SpiceJet, you have to travel as per their convenience, not as per your choice. They may change travelling route & timing as per their convenience without asking you or giving better option or leaving you any other choice. You have to travel as per them or cancel  the ticket is only option.

He gave a very clear and almost correct presentation to passengers with Emergency Exit. I was paying attention....and being a Professor of English in a Central University, currently Pro-Vice Chancellor, I couldn't resist complimenting him and also telling him that there is no word as 'Luggages' - LUGGAGE, BAGGAGE, WATER, MILK, etc. are both singular AND plural. He was open to my correction: a very uncommon quality! And we talked more, the flight being almost empty. Angrezji will go far wherever he serves. He has an open mind ready to sponge extra knowledge!

Never Again,someplace-somewhere,Bengaluru - Ahmedabad,"I had a flight from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad today scheduled to depart at 5:30 in the evening.Yesterday Spicejet sent a message saying that the timing has been revised to 06:00.I thought it's fine as flight is just postponed by 30 minutes and that will not impact my schedule. Today I reached Bengaluru airport and a surprise was waiting for me. Spicejet executive  told me that my flight left at 6:00 AM in the morning.

I had never heard of any flight being preponed by 12 hours ever in my life.When later I started thinking about this I realized what did Spicejet do. They cancelled the evening flight and transferred the evening passengers to their regular morning flight probably due to low occupancy.Instead of cancellation they called it revising the schedule. 

This was very unethical and on top of that their executives were very rude and trying to put the blame on passengers.
Anyways I have decided to never travel with them again even if I need to pay more for other flights.Thhis was the second time I had a terrible experience with them and it's time to say goodbye to them.",Domestic,1.0,August 2021,1 August 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Worst service, never think about spicejet in your dreams. Didn't get the refund yet.",Md Wasim,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Surat,"There was no other option but writing this review about the experience with spicejet. I rarely write reviews but I strongly feel my booking with Spicejet should serve as a warning to all passengers who are thinking of travelling with them.

I had a booking with Spicejet on 25th March 2020 (ignore the July 2020 as it was the earliest option I could choose) but the airline cancelled the flight due to Covid. Spicejet has claimed that they would refund me for the tickets as it was cancelled twice and further I didn't travel.

16 months later, I have yet to receive the full refund. On several occasions, Spicejet has claimed the refund would be paid within days, and when no refund is found in my account, they claim a 'technical glitch' is the cause.

After many mails and calls they have refunded only INR 2419 instead of INR 7019. Even they are not responding the mails for months. I have already paid INR 800 as convenience fee which is non refundable.

I have filed grievance claims, and may have to resort to suing Spicejet, as it seems our refund will be forever 'under process' (Spicejet's phrase which probably means nothing is being done).
I hope this review will publicly shame Spicejet into paying my full refund (and probably many other passengers).

Worst Airline and OTA,Bhoomika,Jabalpur - New Delhi,"Worst experience .
Despite current pandemic situation and the lockdown in all states to curb an increase of exposure .Makemytrip and Spice Jet expect passengers to travel despite connecting flights being cancelled by the airlines.
We had a trip from Chennai to Mumbai and Mumbai to Jabalpur which was cancelled duet the flights being cancelled. And the return trip was from Jabalpur to Delhi and connecting flight to Chennai back . Since our flights for the onward journey were cancelled and return journey from Delhi to chennai were cancelled due to the pandemic we tried asking for a future credit for our spice jet flight on 24th May 2021 from Jabalpur to Delhi but both the airline and makemtrip refused to understand the whole situtaion and want us to travel exposing ourselfs to the virus .
Will they take the responsibility if something happens to us. 
Here the world is faceing the worst situation and this is what they say. 
Want to understand who will make them accountable for their actions. 
Do the people have to suffer like this or can we create some accountabilty .

At the ticket counter, did not bother to check that I had paid for the upgrade and gave me my boarding pass and I left, when I reached Mangalore my bag was not to be found for almost 45 minutes to get my bag. I had put a formal complain and nothing was done about, all they mentioned is we will look into the matter, that is how unprofessional they are.
When it come to taking my cash they don't waste time, but to have this issue resolved and reimbursed the cash they said we will look into the matter which will never happen.

Same day another flight from PNQ-Delhi-DXB was there charging 18K INR but was not landing before travel ban hence I went for 50K Pune- Ahmedabad-Dubai.
I got sms at 8:30PM that tomorrows flight got reschedule to mooring 8:30 AM which will go to Delhi.
Now SpiceJet don't have single reason why they changed my flight which is not going to land in Dubai.
No response from customer care, I went to Delhi and found that crew is clue less and they told me Ahmedabad flight also got cancelled.
You can take other flight complete refund will be done. I tool Indigo flight paying 62K at Delhi.
Later I come to know that Ahmadabad flight never got cancelled but they were selling tickets at higher rates hence they moved me to morning flight which was definitely going to cancel.

I have been waiting in the que for boarding and in front of me many customers gone with higher weight and in my turn I had 2 kg extra and I have been instructed to pay 60Dhs per kg for excess weight. I completely honour their terms and conditions but my question is that the policy should be uniform to all customers. I don’t understand the logic behind different terms according to the face value of customers. They are favouring some customers according to their wish and relaxed for more than 10kg. When I tried to ask this to their ground staff, they were so arrogant and impatient. They kicked me out from the que and rudely told if you don’t want to pay throw your item. I have been travelling in this sector for past 17 years and used many carriers. Never experienced such behavior earlier.
When I entered the flight, again surprising that there is no space to keep my hand baggage in rack. They have collected such a heavy amount and I had to keep that items below my seat compromising leg space.I didn’t see any kind of customer service training in their team.

THE MOST INCONVENIENT AIRLINE EVER,Hridaya Kripalani,Dharamsala - New Delhi,"WORST AIRLINE TO TRAVEL IN!

Do yourself a favor, save your money and time! Pay a few extra bucks and make your life easier. These people are completely unprofessional and WAY TOO rude to the customers. 

I was flying from Dharamshala to Delhi today. Had a same day flight back! There wasnt any flight scheduled back to Delhi for today after this one.

So, my flight was scheduled to depart at 1.45! Boarding time was 1.15. Dharamshala airport is small like a private airport, so it’s in and out. 

I couldn’t do a web check-in because their website was messing up. Either way, I thought I’ll just grab a boarding pass from the airport kiosk and head to security because I only had my laptop bag with me and NO CHECK IN LUGGAGE. 

I got to the airport at 1.10pm because of unexpected traffic in Dharamshala. Again, boarding time was 1.15pm. 

BUT, here’s the catch! THE FLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE GATE AT 1.10 which is 35 minutes before the departure time! I was on a business trip where the schedule was tight. They can’t do this as per their convenience. 

I was so surprised because I didn’t get any communication from them, neither did my travel agent receive any form of communication. 

All I had to do was get a boarding pass, head to security and walk to the aircraft. It would’ve taken 10-15 mins at the Dharamshala airport. I could see spicejets employee behind the counter, NOT CLOSED but since the flight was pushing backkkk from the gate AT SPICEJETS CONVENIENCE, so they reported me as a NO SHOW. PUSHING BACK EARLY WHEN EVERYBODYS BOARDED SEEMS REASONABLE! How can you push back without all your passengers there? It’s not like it was informed two three days before that the timings are changing or I would’ve canceled the whole flight and changed plans because those timings didn’t work for my trip. 

STOP STEALING FROM THE CUSTOMERS! I want my money back or redeemed for a future flight because this is no professionalism. 

I was mistaken to have not checked in online, I accepted that to them. But, the website was giving me so much trouble. Even then, it wouldn’t have mattered because a gentlemen who had checked in online was also denied to board at 1.10. AND HIS BOARDING PASS SAID BOARDING AT 1.15. - in total 4 people missed their flights because of this crap.

#banspicejet because this is a regular  complain with this damn airline. I have had similar experiences before and this is probably the last time I’ll be flying with them. 

THERE WAS A MAN WHO DIDNT GET TO BOARD WITH ME AND HE KEPT CRYING AND REQUESTING TO BOARD BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMEONE SICK IN THEIR FAMILY. HE WASNT VERY WELL OFF EITHER THAT HE COULD AFFORD TO BUY ANOTHER PLANE TICKET.

Amazing Customer service,Satish,Mumbai - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I, Mr. Satish Villait, flew from BOM to CCU under the PNR - ECDYGG. Flight no - SG370.
This is to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the wonderful ground staff that they have at the Kolkata airport. I want to specifically mention about the gentleman in the check-in counter that dealt with us. Mr. Gautam, was reflecting an extraordinary degree of customer care. Not just Gautam but also the female staffs assisting him for our query, they were modeling the behaviour of serving the guests to all ends in its best form. Due to the ongoing covid situation and covid tests, we had to wait back and rebook our flight from CCU to IXR which made us agitated and restless but on the contrary Mr. Gautam assisted us by being most polite and calm, he didn't express any discomfort or uneasiness in tackling the situation. And also promised us partial refund which was going out of his way to help us with the situation.  What was striking me hard was his gentle composure and smooth shift of communication skill, without any sense of counter transference that could generally arise due to an apathetic customer. They have definitely done a very good job in nurturing and grooming such staff, for which I congratulate them. I am looking forward to my next Spice Jet flight, not only for a flying experience of my money's worth but also for the delight that their staff could make us experience by their behaviour par excellence.

In few words they were more concerned about our safety than we ourselves can possibly be.

I can happily say that I met few amazing crew members serving in this hospitality field;
The MAGNIFICENT NANDITA (spreading positivity in pandemic simply by assisting us by smiling her heart out, her dazzling, sparkling eyes made us forget about the pandemic) and the KIND JHANVI (polite and very prompt at everyone's request) these two gorgeous ladies helps us experiencing a very smooth and ease journey.The way they are handling the passengers was delightful to experience.

Love you SpiceJet!,aviationgeek737,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"SG198 BLR-DEL :
I reached BLR Airport early and checked in by myself at the self checkin counter at the airport the agent assisting at the self checkin kiosk was really really friendly and assisting every single passenger depending on their own needs, after spending a few hours at the airport it was time for me to board VT-SYR operating as SG198, the aircraft was extremely clean! I used alcohol based wet wipes to wipe my tray table even though it was sanitized and clean before i boarded, and after i was done wiping it i could not see a thing on the wet wipes cloth which i used! coming to the service, I was left with no words! i prebooked my food and the first thing i noticed was the value for money! Other low cost airlines charge their passengers 200 for a sad, cold sandwich where'as i was getting a full meal for that same price! That made a really really good value for money also back in Nov 2019 i flew with an airline in India which was rated as 5 stars recently and as i began eating that traw i could finish it as soon as the cabin crew reached 2 rows behind me but here that was not the case, At SpiceJet i asked for a small amount of something and was given a handful! That really felt awesome also to mention that the crew who served me chicken schezwan first called the passengers by their name, same was the case for me but i was sitting at my seat doing something else and the crew waiting holding it, waiting for me to finish doing my whatever i was doing! such a great gesture because the other,""blue"" airlines in India who serve just sandwiches don't even be professional, just take the money and throw the sandwich sort of a thing kind of attitude is what they have. But at SpiceJet that's miles apart from those,""blue"" airlines and that is what makes a remarkable difference in my point of view!! Then the cabin light's where dimmed after the clearance was done, That's just the small details which matters the most in such cases like the cabin's interior light had mood lighting equipped which was red in color and the aircraft had SpiceScreen, The quality of announcements by the cabin crew and Captain Rahul Sharma along with his First Officer Aman Bhatia - Their quality of airmanship truly can not be met anywhere else in the entirety of the 737 fleet there is in India across ANY airline! The entire set of Cabin Crew, Tarannum, Zeenat, Tashi and Arpana where extremely active all throughout the cabin! If by any chance a passenger wouldn't be feeling that good in the flight, SpiceScreen was there to help that passenger stay happy and high in passenger comfort, how can i mention how well was i treated! probably the best flight i've ever had in 2020! Truly the best hands down! There are good experiences and then there are good experiences that change your experience into an emotion, the fact that I'm writing such a long and comprehensive feedback actually proves it, also before and after booking my flight with SpiceJet i was continuously looking at the reviews on tripadvisor and undoubtedly all reviews had 5 stars! That's understandable why from the baggage drop till the deboarding, every single thing was super awesome and taken care of specially the experience at the baggage belt arrival, his name was Mr. Manish Kumar! wearing a red colored SpiceJet t shirt (Not the first time I've appreciated SpiceJet's Delhi based employees) really well mannered and well trained, definitely says why SpiceJet deserves 4 stars (highest any Low Cost Airline has gotten) all left alone, I'll hands down give SpiceJet 5 stars! without a doubt there's a saying that if you do someone good then they'll remember it for more than 5 years or for years to come even if it's been really long and SpiceJet has proved it! Also a special mention to Mr. Aamir Bhat who wasn't on my flight but tried the best he could in his power to help also to the boarding staff at the gate (gate 17) I'll probably never even have such an awesome experience with any other,""blue low cost airline"" thanks to all proverbly my words can't express into emotion on the level of service i've received. Will hands down take SpiceJet over ANY overrated low cost/full service airline in the future if there's any airline capable of 5 stars, it's SpiceJet!

"Unprofessional, under-trained & unethical staff/airlines",Sayak Adhikari,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bengaluru,"1. The flight delayed by almost 5 hours without any proper information from the airlines/staff.

2. Once we boarded the flight, there was already an elderly couple at our seats who had the same seat numbers mentioned in their boarding pass as well. When we informed the ground staff, they blatantly refused it was a computer error/human error (how illiterate of them) and asked us to seat in different places which where we were poles apart from each other. They even threatened to de-board us when we complained stating we were causing the delay of the flight (when the flight was already delayed for 5 hours).

3. At the BLR airport, the airhostess announced that the luggage can be collected from conveyor belt# 7. Since, I've been a frequent traveler via BLR airport, I was well aware that there are only 6 belts. When politely requested the airhostess to reconfirm stating the obvious, she rudely answered - ""Sir, our staff knows the airports better; please do as you're advised or else you can sort your own issues with the airport authority!"" (Wowww)

 The best part with I enjoyed was when they announced my name in flight (cause I was not sitting on my seat) while I was sleeping, for serving me breakfast. This is something which I have never experienced before.

Excellent flight and service.,Aziz Shafi,Durgapur - New Delhi,"Flying from a Tier 3 airport in India has its own merits and scope of improvement. We took the SpiceJet Flight 507 to DEL and had a great experience. 

We thoroughly enjoyed the service of the cabin crew Mr. Sayed and Ms. Ankita and found them to be on top of their game WRT courtesy, competency and responsiveness. They are SpiceJet stars and in my view, they should be recognised for displaying warmth, hospitality and safety creating differentiation. 

Also, while it's great that GoI is connecting more and more smaller towns to metro cities, I do hope with so much of engineering expertise and resources in the country, we should construct world class sustainable airports from Day ONE and not small railway stations on steroids in the name of an airport. going forward, make airports paperless, automated baggage scanners, better facilities, aero bridges, etc. Come on,  That's the only way our airports can be future proof and truly incredible.

Thank you Spice Jet for a differentiated wonderful experience. Cheers.",Domestic,5.0,February 2021,15 February 2021,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Hostess on flight with untie hair walking in flight with half worn shoes looks so unprofessional.

Spice Jet is doing great job as they started flight for Chakeri Airport 

Flight was delayed for more than 1 hour but  it was no fault of spice jet , it was due Kanpur have foggy season in these months and there is no facilities like Lucknow Airports if visibility is too low.

I am very glad that even flight was delayed , spice jet provided us cookies and fruitee Drink. Good guys.

This flight is Q400 and spice jet have good ambiance inside that was very nice.

Both flight staff were very nice and polite.

I hope UP government should sooner make better facilities for Kanpur Airport.

Work experience and worst behaviour of staff in airport,Ravi,Dubai - Kolkata (Calcutta),I traveled in SpiceJet from Dubai to kolkata with PNR - R79BJY recently. It was worst experience with them they are just forced to loot money from passengers. As I have a Tv with 49 inches and no other language they have charged 250 AED as a handling charges and over sized charges extra. The money is more than half of the ticket value And it was horrible experience. But still I was I was ok and moved on. And before boarding into the flight there is a weight machine placed and everyone needs to go through it and the people who are in charge of that process was very rude and no manners towards elders I have observed their behaviour and they have asked people to pay 70 AED for one kg. Which is very mean and treating passengers like a labour class and treating passengers.Staff in Dubai was not at all supportive and made my travel experience worst. Mine was 7.8 kg and they have demanded me to pay 70 AED. It’s fine having 1 or 2 kg extra. They are people with 4 or 5 kg they have charged equals to their itinerary fare.

Spicejet are Worst Airline and non cooperative,Saurabhdas01,New Delhi - Dehradun,"I started my journey from Saudi Arabia and I had a GoAir ticket. Due to travel restriction choice of Airlines are limited. When my luggage was weighed at Saudi it was 11.5 kg. 
Flight landed at New Delhi Airport from where I had a connecting flight to Dehradun. The next flight I booked was of Spicejet and from Duty Free I purchased 2 alcohol bottles. At the Spicejet ticket counter I was asked to put the 2 alcohol bottles each of 1 ltr into the luggage as it is not allowed to carry them via Immigration. 
Later when the luggage was weighed it showed 20.5 kgs. Which was surprising for me. Seems there is something fishy in their weighing scale. 
I am a Merchant Navy Captain and aviation industry has to give special preference to Merchant Navy personnel as both industries are interlinked. Also Merchant Navy crew are frequent flier. The Counter female clearly refused for any consideration,then I asked her superior and she too behaved in a very arrogant manner. For me I definitely can pay for extra luggage but it was an insult to my rank and my profession. 
For sure any crew flight ticket arrangement in future will not be arranged by Spicejet by me. I don't want my fellow crew members to face the same humiliation I faced.

Rude behavior from Spicejet Captain!!!!,meetheen,Dammam - Kozhikode,"Comments	I was travelling with my family Dammam - Calicut on 10 Dec 2020 by flight number SG9918 and we really enjoyed the trip during the full trip including the check in. However we would like to draw your attention to one of the bad incident from your employee. Our seats were 3A and 3B and entered the flight almost at the end of the boarding process. We were trying to accommodate our hand baggage within the available space within the overhead compartment. In between one person occupying seat 1F started shouting us not to touch his bags!!! We were thinking that it is a crazy passenger but later on found from the crew that it is the captain of Spicejet!!!! It was a shocking moment and we have never came across such an arrogant airline staff, whether national OR international carrier. We are not able to understand how can spicejet afford such a bad person as your captain especially during this COVID season. We tried to complain to the crew but it was of no use since the captain is above all of them. We request your office to have an investigation to this incident and let us know the corrective actions from your side. We had the videos and photos of this person and were planning to put it on social media and travel forums but decided to look for your opinion before such acts. We are ready to provide any further information required by you to complete the investigation process and we are eagerly waiting for your action plans. We do not want such an experience to any passenger any time hence an urgent support and action plan from Spicejet team will be highly appreciated.",International,2.0,December 2020,30 December 2020,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

Worst travel ever,Farha,Dubai - Kozhikode,"Worst experience ever! I was travelling from dubai to india alone with my one year old daughter. Since I was alone, i was planning to checkin her stroller and the 7kg cabin baggage so that I can walk freely with my daughter. So I got the stroller wrapped(which costs about 30aed) and went to the counter. The lady at the counter was very rude to me and asked me to pay for checking them in or to open my stroller and take the 7kg hand luggage of mine and 7kg hand luggage of my daughter with me. How can someone be so merciless? I have been in many airlines and never have I experienced such appalling behavior. So I had to carry them and my daughter was in a bad mood that day. She didn't want to sit on the stroller. So i had to carry her and push the stroller as well. By the time i reached the plane I was exhausted. I had a back ache and my baby was tired too. I had to ask others to help me fold my stroller up, put the bags up and finally when I sat down i realised that the food is paid only. No conplimentaries. Why did I even pay for my infant if there is no seat, no food or no baggage allowance for her. How am I supposed to carry her luggage and mine with the stroller. The flight got delayed and by the time we landed i was  really tired and hungry. And guess what! I got the stroller after all my suitcases were received.  So i had to wait for a long time to get it. So what was the point in making me suffer if it all went to the same area of the plane. Worst nightmare.

Being frequent traveler noticed best ever experience with SpiceJet. Overall everyone was great with all service points and to their extended assistance but just missing name of the crew staff may be Ms. Swarna or starting with ‘S’ Alpacas in SG-244 was excellent with smiling face for assistance with courtesy towards to guest on board. Professionally she was performing her services and she also understood guest on board need and requirement proactively before they could ask for the assistance following all the New to normal Covid-19 protocols which I highly recommended and love to travel with SpiceJet. Unfortunately on same flight my luggage trolley bag was damaged from base and torn from side may be during loading or unloading tried to find someone there but then left Airport.

"Insensitive, inhumane airline with pathetic customer service",RakhiSingh86,Bengaluru - Patna,"And I thought Indigo policy of not allowing kids on certain rows was anti-family till I met SpiceJet. 

Today my family is travelling to Patna from Bengaluru. The party includes a mother, a normal 6-year-old, and a special needs 8 years old. I diligently pre-selected seats because my special needs child has sensory issues and finds it difficult to travel at the end of the airplane.

At the very last moment after my family boarded the flight Spicejet decided not to respect the pre-paid seats, and split a party fo 2 less than 8 years old kid and a mother to the opposite end of the airplane ( row 4 and row 23) 

The customer service is unreachable. They are highly unmanned and use a chatbot. The customer service will show an average contact time of half an hour. 

The SM customer service is merely platitude like accept our apology that we don't mean, and then contact us separately to get a resolution.

What is the meaning of charging people for seat selection when you can choose to not respect them at any time? How do you accept a party of a mother and 6 and 8 yr old child to travel by sitting at polar opposite ends of aircraft?

Special treatment/highly caring for passengers,Rituparn Raghuvanshi,Varanasi - Ahmedabad,"I personally recommend SpiceJet flights.

They couldn’t connect my checkin luggage in same flight but within difference of 1.5hrs it reached to destination airport by another airline. It was simply awesome

Unwilling to accept responsibility,John S,Mumbai - Kochi (Cochin),"SpiceJet messaged me on 15th October saying that our 18th November flight from Mumai to Kochi on SG282 at 15:50 was now flight SG 476 departing at 20:30. They referred to this as a ""rescheduling"". To my mind this was a late cancellation of SG 282, which created an unacceptable delay to our plans. SpiceJet had even sent us electronic boarding passes for SG 282. I then discovered SpiceJet had changed the flight again, without telling me, to SG 316 departing Mumbai at 18:45. Email exchanges with Customer Experience were useless, they wouldn't accept that SpiceJet had cancelled our original flight and said I had to phone the 24/7 Reservations Helpline ""for security reasons"". After four attempts I got through at 03:30 (Indian time). Again, no acceptance that SpiceJet had cancelled SG 282, all I could do was cancel SG 476/SG 316 (and a connecting flight) as the flight times were no use to us, and pay cancellation fees. Really poor customer service from SpiceJet - and it cost the Sterling equivalent of INR 2,200 in phone bills from the UK. Not impressed.

"Amazing Service, AWESOME CARE BY Flight Crew",PPAI275,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bengaluru,"Dear Concern,

This is to bring it to your notice that this about my Travel on 23rd October 2020 on Flight No. SG 516, KOL-BLR, PNR JC9ZNW. Please find the attached ticket for your reference. 

This is about the exceptional quality and services your airline brings a lot of joy to our lives.

Since Travel is extremely risky and Spicejet has just made me feel safe only because of two things, The care from the AWESOME CREW and Hygiene from the aircraft Maintenance. 

It was an early morning flight and during Navratri in Kolkata, I was exhausted and very much irritated when I had entered the flight itself. I was greeted by a wonderful smile and warm welcome by Ms. Dhanya Devasia, The first thing she asked me was Sir, If you don’t mind can I offer you some water. You look very tired. It relieved my Pain and They say the first impression or First thing in Hospitality about how do you approach someone. 

This is not the first time I have flown with SG. SG is my domestic travel partner and as always I have seen much crew on many flights back and forth.

I think there is an appreciation day for everything so I’m sure there is a Flight Attendant Appreciation Day — but I think that should be every single time you get on a plane. 

Treating people good and making them comfortable even when they don’t matter to you is something you don’t find in anybody. 

Honestly, If I am writing such a long post indicates how happy I was during my journey. 

Flight attendants are not there to make your drinks, serve your food, and wait for hand and foot on you. 
Their #1 reason for existing and being on your flight is to keep you safe. Period. 

I informed Ms. Dhanya Devasia About my issue with Sinus, and how my ears create horrible pain. I can write and give it to you, Every 5 Mints Ms. Dhanya Devasia Herself or Ms. Aishwarya Bagewadi coming to me and giving me hot water to sip, taught me some jaw exercise by Dhanya Devasia.

Everything else is a perk. All-day long, these men and women put up with rude people, people who don’t listen to instructions, people who actually physically abuse them, and so much more. 

I have Attached two gift cards for these two beautiful and amazing souls. I hope this reaches them. It's a token of gratitude for taking care of me on the course of the flight.

Once Again Mr. Dhanya Devasia Amazing Job. You make Spicejet Proud. I am Proud to Travel on Spicejet.

People Make Organisations and I am sure you have the right people for it. Good Work Spicejet. Keep It Up.",Domestic,5.0,October 2020,8 November 2020,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Humanitarian spiceness!!,Nitin,Jaisalmer - New Delhi,"This is regarding my latest flight SG 942 to Delhi from Jaisalmer on the 29th of October 2020. I was travelling back from my honeymoon with my wife and she couldn't have anything for food when we checked out of our hotel due to some issue she had. When we arrived at the airport, we hadn't expected that there would not be any outlet to even have snacks. We were really stranded at the airport for a good 5 hours and my wife had a real tough time negotiating the over fasting that she was carrying over from the past night. When we boarded the flight, I requested onboard cabin crew, Ms Anupriya to help me with some eatable for my wife (I explained the situation to her).  She politely affirmed and asked me to wait for some time as in these covid times, there are no meals for sale, if there is no pre booked meal on board. She then discussed the matter with Mr Kush, her senior and they both assured that they would be helping us in the condition.

Very poor and rude on ground staff (horrible experience) flight SG3477,Anoop,Bengaluru - Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum),"The on ground staffs are rude and not of any help .  My flight was timing was 17:20 and the boarding time mentioned on ticket was 16:50. I reached at the check-in counter at 16:15 the staff denied to check-in my baggage.they told the boarding has already started there was no prior intimation. The staff was of no help rudely told you if you want to go you have to leave your luggage and go or try taking the luggage and see if they allow at the boarding gate. Instead of helping out they are putting the passenger's in a panic situation. I had to carry the luggage through all the security checks had to explain all the security personnel for carrying such a big luggage.

I would not want any other passengers to go through what I went. I will not recommend any one to travel through spice jet.

Mishandled Baggage,deeksha g,Bengaluru - Gwalior,"I boarded a flight of spicejet from Bangalore to gwalior on 29th aug.

Flight :- SG 3325
PNR:- S8Z5TI

I checked in at 8:45 A.M where departure time is 9:50 A.M.

Spice-jet Team scanned and checked our bag in Bangalore and took our bag for boarding.A power bank is there our check-in bag but they didn't check and scanned properly which we forget to take out from that check-in bag.

We boarded the flight on last moment one of crew member gave that detail to some other lady that this is the authority letter you have to sign where we found power bank on your bag and we can't board that bag it will come on next day on next flight that lady denied and said my bag doesn't have power bank.
On last moment he searched me and came to me saying please sign this authority letter power bank is there on your bag ,he said please sign this as we cannot take power bank and it will come tomorrow, I asked power bank you will take out from my bag? And forward my bag? Suddenly one air-hostess  came and took that paper from him and she told yes mam we found power bank they will wrap that power bank and send it on next day and bag we are forwarding now only after taking it out.i said ""ok"" we forget that power bank it's our mistake ,only 5 mins left for flight to start they asked me to sign soon, without reading and trusting on that air-hostess  I signed that paper.

As soon as I landed Gwalior I got a call from spice-jet that your bag is at Bangalore airport ask someone to take it and you signed that authority letter.

I was in shock my all stuffs including original documents, my money, everything is there on my bag and its not handled properly.my heart was on my mouth.

I literally scared and told him what are you talking nobody is there in Bangalore who will take my bag and I need my bag now he said we will send it on tomorrow's flight only.

I am girl from Chhatarpur (m.p) to reach my native place on this pandemic from Bangalore.I took Bangalore-Gwalior spice-jet flight and post reaching to Gwalior I took my personal cab to reach to my native which is 250 km from Gwalior.

As I doesn't belong to Gwalior  who will come next day to Gwalior airport to take my bag as nobody is here in Gwalior ,I discussed it with Gwalior spice-jet people over there named Vishnu and Sushmita ,we had a 2hrs of discussion. They took our native address and said we will try to send.

It's been 5days I didn't receive my bag they are saying it's on Gwalior airport we are not able to find vendor .we found one vendor he is asking 3 thousand rupees if you pay we will send and it's not our responsibility.That too they are saying after two days.

On this pandemic situation they want a girl to come again 250 km to take her bag again on airport because of their mistake .
Such inhuman behavior I have seen.

I am sleepless ,worried, concerned not able to sit on this anxiety. 

I am really want my bag back and I want my power bank also.
I thought leave the power bank but now i want everything back as you dont  deserve even 1 rupee of mine for this irresponsible and inhumane behavior.

I am really frustrated and I will not leave spice-jet at all and I will take social media help  to get it resolved. 

Below is the compliant raised number and all details

PNR:S8Z5TI
Flight/Date: SG3325/29 AUG
Number of Mishandled Bag(s): 1
Bag 1
Tag No:0775191687

But no response till yet i am only receiving mails saying, we tried to call you but you are not reachable.

First of all very less leg room, low air conditioning that made us difficult in breathing while wearing PPE kit as well as toilets horribly dirty filthy on top of that crews were a bit unprofessional but this didn’t make any difference against the overall discomforts that we had on this flight.

It is clear from other posts that I‘m not the only one with this problem.
To add insult to injury, a „customer experience“ person from SpiceJet responds to these posts, asking complaining reviewers to contact the airline to get things straight. This leaves the impression to the public, that they actually want to sort out the problem. Not true!

Very unethical Airline, who does not adhere to their own policy. We pay extra money to buy refundable tickets as we are unsure of the future and Spice jet take it as a chance to make money.
They are not giving me an extension either.

Shady Business,Bamboo66,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Varanasi,"Well, this flight never took place as the route was cancelled by the airline. However, the way this situation was handled should be a warning to anybody intending to book SpiceJet.
In the cancellation email the airline claimed: ""The entire amount (for the booking) will be maintained in a credit shell"". There was no option for a refund; just this obscure ""credit shell"".
I re-booked the flight via Delhi, used the ""credit shell"" and paid a surcharge for the two sector flight with my credit card. 

Unfortunately, I had to cancel this flight and asked for a refund on my credit card. 
SpiceJet is denying to give this refund. Reason given: ""You paid with a credit shell"". Explaining that the ""credit shell"" (which, as I had to find out, is rather a time-bomb) was not an option I was given when the airline cancelled my original flight, does not count. The refund on the credit card is denied. What a shady business!

That there are other ways to conduct proper business was shown by VISTARA, the new domestic airline in India. I also had to cancel one of their flights - and within two days my credit-card was credited with the amount.

I understand that the coronavirus has changed a lot of policies, but at least the price has to change.

After i reached Mumbai at 17:00 my flight to Jaipur at 5:30 am got cancelled. They booked the next days flight from Mumbai to Ahemdabad to Jaipur at 17:40 reaching Jaipur at 22:00. I had to wait 25 hours at Mumbai airport in a totally unknown city. They did not provide me with any place to stay or sleep and the worst nothing was managed from their side to eat. I was there just waiting for 25 hours. I had the worst experience. Not a single member from the spicejet staffs helped me or even listened to my problem. All the reason i was given was due to Covid-19 we can not do anything to help you. Such a disgress.

SpiceJet cheating and looting customers,Anshul,Mumbai - Kanpur,"Hi,
I have booked a ticket on 20-Jun-20 for 1-Jul-20 however I have not received any confirmation till now for flight number ""OE1END"".  
  
Yesterday, I called customer care and my call was disconnected by Floor manager.

Today, I had a word with SONAM KUMARI, she was rude, unprofessional and she disconnected my call. 

When I called customer care they said the flight is cancelled as per Government instructions when I requested for the next direct flight they offered me a flight ticket for 1st of August without assurance that flight will not be cancelled.  

And the second option offered by them is a connecting flight via Delhi. Why should I go choose a connecting flight, when I have already paid for direct flight.

Moreover, when I agreed for a connecting flight they are asking for an extra Rs. 3,000. This is how they are cheating and looting customers.  

When I requested a refund they straightway refused to refund and said they can not refund money in my account, the amount will be transferred in the credit shield. 
Why should I accept the credit shield ? I want the money to be refunded in my account.

Aside Consumer count and repeated Tours & travel Minister,

Please look into this!  SpiceJet airlines is using COVID 19 as an opportunity, they are blocking customers' money in their account.

Average ticket cost is Rs.6000
daily impacted customer count is 2000 to 3000
Average money block is Rs. 1,80,00,000

Horrible,Manisha,Hyderabad - Tirupati,"I was visiting India from USA in   Feb/ March. 2020. Had booked  a flight to tirupati  from Hyderabad on spicejet ( SG 467 on 29th Feb 2020  Hyderabad to Tirupati seat no 1A&1B) I was looking forward to this flight as I was super excited  about going to Tirupati . But the  minute I  boarded the flight the excitement had turned into anger. I saw an old  arrogant man seated on seat 1D  treating the crew as if they were his personal servant.  Soon the boarding was completed and the doors were closed. We started taxing towards the runway and  then this  rude man gets up from his seat  as we are taxing and  starts screaming at the crew who were asking  him to sit down as we were about to take off. He wanted the pilot to turn back the aircraft to the gate to pick up his grandson’s stroller as he had got some text from the airline  about his grand child’s stroller been offloaded( by mistake by the airline) at Hyderabad. He was shouting at the crew and threatening them about  getting them fired their job as knew some minister . The crew assured him that the stroller would be delivered by the next flight  which was in the evening but he wouldn’t take no for answer and wouldn’t sit down.He was creating huge  scene.At  this point I am thinking that the airline would take some action against him which normally every  airlines do with  such passengers, that is to offload such passengers  from the aircraft but to my utter surprise the pilot decides to head back to the gate to get the stroller because he was some ministers chamcha. So  we came back to gate and the ground staff asked this man for the boarding pass and the stroller claim tag. That old man did not even attempt to look for it. Instead  he again starts bragging about knowing some minister and how he is going to make sure that the ground staff would loss his job simply for asking. Staff member was only following the protocol of the airline. I was so put off to see the airline bending backwards to please this one minister ‘s chamcha ( couldn’t come up with a better word to describe this abnoxious  old man) and delaying the flight by  more than an hour  for all the other passengers, and the consecutive flights that aircraft was suppose to do for that  entire evening . The crew did not bother  to apologize to the other passengers on board the flight for the delay.Very, very disappointed by the airline  and the pilot for taking such a decision. Not sure if I would ever fly an airline that dances to the tunes of ministers goons. A country where prime minster Modi doesn’t give any such privileges to his own immediate  family we had people like this man who get away with such nonsense because of airlines like spicejet believe in catering to minister’s relatives and chamcha .

"Unprofessional, Non Hygienic and Less customer friendly.",Annapurna K,Jaipur - Surat,"Aircraft and the crew was below average and cane be managed for a short trip. Worst part is their customer service with non transparent and manipulative policies. 

In my instance, I had booked a 2500Rs. ticket with no reschedule fee and cancellation charges. 
Due to Covid-19, I decided to reschedule which I was unable to do online.

When I called, I was told 
- Reschedule charges are 5k(new ticket was 4k), when requested for details of 5k. I was told it is standard. When requested the break down details of 5k, person on call fail to give me the breakdown.

 On further inquiry.

- Cancellation charges are 3.5k

So, if you :
Reschedule - 2.5(booked ticket) + 5(reschedule charges) = 7.5
Cancellation - 2.5(booked ticket)  + 3.5(cancellation fee, more than the ticket ... Lol ) + 4 k( new ticket)= 10k.

I hope spice jet can do the math... Instead of manipulation.

In a lame attempt at customer service, they responded to my review by sending me to their feedback form. To this review I am attaching a screenshot of SpiceJet's silly and ineffective feedback survey. As you can see, although it gives you plenty of opportunity to rate the ""front lines"" folks (e.g., at the check-in counter and at the gate), there is NO WAY to give any type of feedback on their customer service representatives who refuse to help you via e-mail. Likewise, this form does not allow feedback on the fact that their two supposed customer service phone numbers NEVER WORK!

HOW VISTARA IS WINNING THE HEARTS OF THE CUSTOMES,Namrata,Chennai (Madras) - New Delhi,"it's with great disappointment that I have to tell in a situation where the world is facing a pandemic the airlines such as SpiceJet is offering a option of change in date as the only way out for the customers.

Let me tell you this was the first time I had booked a ticket of vistara just to experience the services and firstly the customer care service is so well equipped that I don't even have to wait to get connected. On my request the associate just told me one things Mam, we understand the situation and we want you to be safe at home hence we will do a 100 % refund.

I tried calling you since yesterday and today through my sheer luck at 9.45 I got through and was on a waiting line of 52 minutes after which I was connected to Omkar. And this young chap could not do much as the guidelines of SpiceJet is only permitting change in dates without a pentalty.

In a situation of world crisis where the stocks are crashing and we are at the edge of recession all that we need to do is show loyalty towards customers and empathise the scenario. And not just make revenues by hook or crook.

A traveller is making the plan to visit on city for various serious such as meeting and appointments. I am travelling to visit the government of India and I am not very sure when will I get the appointment next month by 30th April given the situation in Delhi and people anticipating only worse situations to come. 

However I am not getting that support from your airlines. I don't travel often In a year but whenever I do I prefer SpiceJet for the efficency in timings. BUT LET ME BE HONEST TODAY I REGRET FOR NOT BOOKING MY TO AND FRO THROUGH VISTARA FOR THE COMFORT THEY GIVE 

And LET ME TELL YOU THIS GESTURE OF THEIRS WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED FOR EVERY TIME I DECIDE TO TRAVEL. 

I am only going to request you to not making money at a time of crisis and support the traveller, it's not like we don't intend to travel but the government has been issuing way to many bans to even operate. It's a time we join together, I understand that the aviation and travel industry is the most hit and the impacts are huge. But let me tell you together if we all stand we may fight this, if not the costs as individuals will be really high.

Kindly accept my humble request of 100% waiver for the flight booked or you can give a credit not with 6 months validity 

I look forward to hear from you",Domestic,1.0,March 2020,17 March 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Bumpy landing and late,David D,Goa - Mumbai,"Tuesday 3rd March and we were travelling, from Dabolim Airport, Goa to Mumbai, on board SpiceJet flight SG454.

Our flight was due to depart at 13.30 and arrive at 14.55 a scheduled flying time of one hour and 25 minutes 

While waiting in the Departure Lounge, there was an announcement advising passengers of a revised departure time of 13.50, this was further revised to 14.05. The reason given there was a delay in the arrival of the incoming flight due to congestion at Mumbai Airport. 

We started boarding at 13.50 and pushed back from the Terminal at 14.15 and airborne at 14.25. We actually landed in Mumbai at 15.25, which was 30 minutes later than scheduled.

We did purchase some extras, we selected our seats and paid 1,900 Rupees ( roughly £21) for 5kgs extra baggage.

There was an announcement advising passengers that the flight time would be 55 minutes and apologised for the delay.

The aircraft a Boeing B737 - 800, was previously a Jet Airways aircraft. The livery was partially Spicejet with the Jet Airways 
logo on the tail painted out.

The seating was reasonably comfortable with adequate legroom.

The crew were very smartly dressed in their red and black uniforms.

Food was served for those passengers who had prebooked and paid for it, snacks were also on sale.

It was rather wobbly approaching Mumbai, and the landing was rather severe culminating with a slam on breaks.

An average rating might appear a bit harsh, but a rating of very good would have been over generous.",Domestic,3.0,March 2020,3 March 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worst Airline with worlds worst customer service,Snigdha,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"SG 8905 was suppose to depart from IGI Delhi airport at 19:55 on 29 Mar 2019 but was DELAYED FOR 6 HOURS and departed at 1:30 on 1st Mar 2020 on the false pretext of bad weather conditions!! I just have one question: how did the flights of other airlines managed to depart and arrive at Delhi airport if the weather condition was that unpredictable?? Is Spice Jet Boeing flight made of cotton candy that would have melted in the air if it would take off!!

When the passengers began to question the spice jet crew they even had the guts to VERBALLY ABUSE THE PASSENGERS, forget about courtesy, dinner or lounge facility!!
After an hour of heated argument with the crew we came to know that the actual reason was that the crew was late (for 6 hrs) maybe they just quit and left, after all who would work for such a toxic organisation. Well that definitely explains Spice Jet going out of business and if, not I’m pretty sure that’s gonna happen soon. 

After all the drama they managed to bring a crew that was not even able to give safety instructions properly which caused major concerns.

After raising a grievance with Spice Jet the incident was closed ignoring all the concerns and misbehaviour with the false excuse of bad weather conditions!! I can’t believe that this airline has NO REMORSE whatsoever and can treat the passengers with such MISCONDUCT!!

Please just go out of business and save other people from such pain.",Domestic,1.0,February 2020,2 March 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

We were in a shock as this is the 2nd time this has happened to us during our vacation in India...the 1st time was with Air India...they cancelled our flight from Delhi to Jaipur without notification...we had to wait in Delhi Airport 9.5 hrs for the next flight. This time neither we or our travel agent in Canada received any notification from SpiceJet for the flight cancellation...yet for months SpiceJet has been emailing us about their flight discounts and even allowed us to make a meal selection for this flight...it’s Bizarre & Mind-boggling. But here comes a SpiceJet staff member Keath Joseph...he efficiently sorted things out for us...he arranged a refund, helped us book another flight to Male early the next day...he got us booked for an overnight stay @Cochin Airport Courtyard Marriott Hotel. Although we we were disappointed we couldn’t get to the Maldives as scheduled...we comforted to have Keath Joseph taking charge. Thank you, Keath. Much appreciated.

Pleasant journey !!,Monica amaranth,Patna - Chennai (Madras),"It's very obvious that every airlines try to give their best,but they outstand different from each other by doing something which is special or with more warmth.. thanks to SpiceJet for having Such amazing cabin crew members who make it up to the passenger in behalf of all the hassle we go through during the journey...thank you Ms.Aditi and Ms borohko",Domestic,5.0,January 2020,12 February 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Mixed Feelings,Chanda Chaudhary,New Delhi - Goa,"For fellow passengers, all I can say is that SpiceJet is a mixed bag. 

To start with the 1st row is astonishingly uncomfortable. This first row is meant to be a ‘max’ seat but instead it’s cramped and awkward. Everyone of the 6passengers that I was traveling with on a recent trip (despite their size or build) were uncomfortable. Basically SpiceJet took over JetAirways aircrafts and refurbished them for an all-economy flight. If you are flying in such an airport please avoid first few rows. To ‘max’ passengers I’ll say please opt for emergency seat instead

Next comes the service : this is where the airline needs to take a long-hard look. I fly for work every week, sometimes twice a week and often end up with a SpiceJet booking

Their ground crew needs serious dose of training. Especially Harpreet who I’ve had the misfortune of checking-in with on two occasions. And each time her attitude is high-handed. She is inefficient, impolite and in general does her job with plain disdain. 

On the other hand the crew in crew on board, especially Kamna provided exceptional service to passengers who were visibly uncomfortable with the silly ‘max’ seats. Not only did she make this flight exceptionally comfortable for me, i observed as she patiently helped a copassenger - an elderly gentleman - with patience and elegance

People like Kamna make an airline special. I wish her all the best.

I really hope that SpiceJet reads this and brings at least its staff training upto mark so deliver a consistent service experience.",Domestic,3.0,February 2020,12 February 2020,2.0,1.0,N/A,4.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Then my family was informed that there flight will go up to MAA only. Though they arrange for a separate aircraft for MAA to SAG passenger and ask me to board. I told them about my family and ask for reschedule or refund but they refused so I had to refuse boarding, unload my luggage.

No social responsibility,Shraddha H,Hyderabad - Bangkok,"Everyone in the world knows Thailand is second highest affected country for corona virus . 
I was about to travel to Thailand on 3rd of this month with a confirmed return flight on 10th.Considering the serious spread of virus, I decided to cancel the tickets. 

My hotel has refunded a complete amount understanding the serious threat to lives at the moment. 

But hats off to SpiceJet team. They are more concerned towards making money even at this time of threat. When I called the customer care, the lady kept on repeating herself that she’s sorry but that’s the policy. When I told her this cancellation is not for any of my personal reason she repeated again I am sorry ma’am but this is how it works.

When I asked her to transfer me to her supervisor, ( omg can’t stop laughing at this but she said) mam he will tell u the same thing as if she was quite sure he’s gonna say the same. 

And then she mentions mam if u were travelling to HongKong I would have helped you full  refund. WHY should I go to HongKong when I wanna travel to Thailand. 

Nowhere on their website it says every cancellation has 5000 rupees as their fee. It infact mentions 3500 for international flights. She was so confused about what she was talking -just kept repeating the same lines for everything I asked.

This small experience made me so happy. 
I was flying from Hyderabad to Pondicherry on 25th Jan 2020 with my nephew's and family. It was my Nephew's Birthday and He was kind of Waiting for a surprise. I spoke to Ritika(Cabin Crew) and asked her if she can do something to arrange and make some basic arrangements to let him feel special.
Initially she said I ll try sir. And within no minutes Ritika and Kanchan were ready with the Surprise.
Needless to say though it's a small gesture but for a kid it's a pretty big one. He is gonna remember his mid air flight birthday celebrations for lifetime.
Ritika and Kanchan the crew on Spicejet SG1004 gave such a excellent service too. So humbled to fly with SpiceJet. Truly would say ""U r Lucky to have Assets like this. As these kind of Employees are assets to one's Organisation""

Not a great experience,mikep_70,New Delhi - Goa,Flew with Spicejet for the first time on a flight from Delhi to Goa. When you book be prepared to be bombarded with emails asking if you want to upgrade.  I had to amend my preferences with them to stop the daily emails.  That didn't stop them sending emails just before the flight suggesting that I upgrade to SpiceMax. One of the key messages that influenced me to upgrade was the 'Seat with extra legroom'. In reality once I boarded the aircraft the only thing I got was a seat near the front.  Legroom was exactly the same so false advertising and a waste of money.  I have flagged this to SpiceJet customer experience prior to writing this but received a less than satisfactory response.  My advice if you have to fly with SpiceJet - Don't upgrade to SpiceMax!,Domestic,2.0,January 2020,21 January 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,N/A

Cheap not very cheerful,David D,Mumbai - Goa,"Sunday 19th January we travelled on Spicejet flight SG 455 from Mumbai to Goa. The flight was due to depart at 15.35 and landing at 17.05 a scheduled flight of an hour and 30 minutes.

The aircraft pushed back at 15.45 and was airborne at 16.00. We were informed that the flying time would be 50 minutes. We landed at 16.50, which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule.

We travelled as SpiemMAX passengers we got seats with extra legroom. The seating was a bit narrow as the table was in the arm rest which reduced the size of the seat. As a person with a 28 inch waist, I found the seats uncomfortable and a bit of a tight fit, not sure how a larger passengers would cope.

We also received a complimentary meal with non-alcoholic beverage. When booking the flight we pre-ordered the vegetarian option. 

We were served Paneer Tikka Shaslick, which included slices of stuffed tandoori aloo, along with a vegetable croquet. On opening the food tray it did not appear very appetising, did try some, not very nice so was uneaten 

We did also get priority check in and our baggage was off loaded as priority. We had pre paid an additional RS 1,200 for an extra 8 kilos of baggage. This was a connecting internal flight from an International flight with a greater baggage allowance.

Spicejet is a low cost airline with no frills, this was rather apparent as we boarded the aged aircraft which was in need of a refurbishment and modernisation.

The crew's uniform was a pair of black jeans and a red polo shirt with the Spicejet logo on it. Some might consider tacky, we thought it was rather youthful and looked good on the crew.",Domestic,3.0,January 2020,20 January 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Being a weekday and heavy traffic in bangalore they got delayed by 10 mins and arrived at 2:25pm. And they were denied boarding and onward journey stating checkin closed 10 mins back!!  
I have seen airlines like Indigo going extra mile in terms of customer service esp when it comes to dealing with senior citizens. 
And here is an airline going down day by day, be it customer service, etiquette, flight quality etc. 
They simply dont care. The behaviour of the staffs at boarding counter are clear indications of this. 
Ideally this airline should ve closed some years back had it not been bailed out. Then these staff would ve understood the value of hard-earned money.

Book if you have time & patience to sit on the airport,Aditya Shah,Mumbai - Jeddah,"Unlike my past experiences with spice jet, I had high regards and expectations from SpiceJet as I was flying their international flight for the first time. Not only was I disappointed but was surprised to see non apologetic behavior of Spice jet staff in listening to the customer’s concerns. My flight was delayed more than 5 hours. So concerned was spice jet about the delay that offered refreshments for their delay - well don’t get ahead of me yet. The arrangements were for passengers who were inconvenienced were done was on different gate from where they were supposed to board from and that was not near either. More or less the time I was supposed-to land in Jeddah I was still on the tarmac. We were told that the connecting flight from Dhaka arrived late and hence the delay. The logic says if your flight is delayed by more than flight flying time then the passengers on the airport should be compensated and taken care of. Well there was no sign of it. Either case we reached Jeddah early in the morning at 04:30 am which as per schedule was 22:50 previous night. 

This wasn’t one off the case , on my return leg the flight was delayed by 3 hours. Again no sign of passenger sympathy. Even as per Saudi GACA rules if the flight is delayed more than 2 hours the airlines has to provide refreshments at the boarding area. Forget about the refreshments there were no signs of spice jet staff to even attend the passengers. As soon as we land in Mumbai our immigration was done in less than 1 minute as I was once of the first to get off the aircraft and I had to rush home since I was flying out again in less than 12 hours considering the delay.

Treated us like cattle ! In humane experience.,rashi a,Dubai - Mumbai,"How can one treat a person like this? We were flying spice jet from Dubai to Mumbai and then to USA . We had 8 hours to make our international connection. Our flight fro. Dubai was supposed to take off at 12:10pm so we got to the airport at 9:00am (due to rains most cabs refused to take us) we get there and there is no one at the gate till 12 . Then a spice jet rep comes tell us that the flight is delayed and looks for info on the board. It said rescheduled to 2:00 then 3:30.. then 5pm and then suddenly our flight number stopped showing up on the board. No spice jet rep was there in the entire airport. The Dubai airport told us to contact the airline as they would not help us. We called the Indian spice jet office and were promised that the flight would take off at 8pm. Nothing and no one showed up at 8 to the gate. Then we called again and were told it was rescheduled to fly at 3am . Little did we know that Our nightmare had just begun as we were traveling with two little hyper energetic boys age 3 and 7. As always we reach the gate at 3 and no one . We waited there till 4:25am and then out of no where a rep came and started boarding . We got into a bus and they drove us to the aircraft . We were delighted . The bus got us to the aircraft but the bus driver refuses to open the gate. We knocked and pleaded but he could not hear us from the other side. We sat in the bus for 2 hours before they opened the gate. Finally we boarded the aircraft and were so tired that we went to sleep after the pilot announced that we will reach there in 2.5 hours. We woke up at 9am to be told that the pilot had to take the other flight to Calicut and the entire crew with him. We had to deplane and go back and wait for further instructions. Crazy right! Now when we get off we are made thru go thru security and given Mc Donald vouchers. There was a 2 hour wait to get to the food so we decided to skip the line and pay somewhere else. We finally were told that the next flight was booked for 5pm. With no hope left we reached the gate like idiots at 5pm. Thankfully the flight took off at 7pm . Got our bags soaked thru and through with water and damaged in Mumbai. We missed all our interconnections, hotel bookings as we had no insurance. I’m surprised Dubai airport did not help us nor did the spice jet apology to date. horrible experience. Can never travel to Dubai ever again. Or take spice jet.

"Very uncomfortable seating arrangement even for paid seats, good food and in-flight services",de-aritra,Mumbai - Dehradun,"They charge you Rs 1,200 for premium seats and I paid Rs 2,400 for two premium seats. Couldn’t fit my bum in what was supposedly their most comfortable and premium seat (front row). Moved to third row and had to keep my legs folded for the entire trip.
A much shorter and around 60kg old lady sitting next to me also could not sit without legs folded. Have never faced these issues in any other airlines including Indigo, GoAir, Vistara.

The entire mood for the trip became sour and I will never fly Spicejet again.

On the positive side, the air steward tried to pacify me. The pre-booked meal was of good quality too. The service by air steward and air hostesses was good too. 

But sitting in such an uncomfortable posture for a 2 hour + flight when you have paid so much for comfy seats is just not done",Domestic,1.0,January 2020,14 January 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Delayed...again...,wjw2018,Goa - Chennai (Madras),"For Christmas my friend and I decided to spend a couple of weeks on the east coast of India, travelling around Tamil Nadu, so we booked flights through a search engine and came up with Spicejet as being the most convenient time as well as the best price combination. To give them credit, we did receive an SMS in plenty of time advising us that the flight had been delayed by 2 hours, so we were able to adjust our taxi times to leave later and meet up at the airport. Once there, we checked in together and were given a window and an aisle seat since the aircraft was only a relatively small turbojet Bombardier Q400. We went through security and waited in the departure hall where after some time there was an announcement that we could collect some food and water at the gate due to the delay. They gave us a carton of spicy vegetable biryani and some water which helped but we still arrived much later than planned and had to stay closer to the airport rather than in Chennai due to the later arrival time. It was just an average flight, but the seats reclined a little and we were able to sleep...and water was provided.  But it does seem that more and more frequently these days flights out of Goa particularly are very often delayed....",Domestic,4.0,N/A,13 January 2020,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

In addition to my initial review of Budget Airline and Fly SpiceMax - Degrading with time,AjayGaur,New Delhi - Hong Kong,"Initially with the launch of HK-Delhi sector all was good and slowly the airline picked up its original behavior of being late, delays and below par crew services. Out of a handful of such lousy experience sharing the recent one (11th Jan 2020) flew from Delhi to Hong Kong and the flight got delayed by almost 3+hours. The journey of a passenger starts not from the time of boarding the flight but the taxi from hotel/residence. I felt this time the travel was never ending. The temp. in the flight was not optimum, the pre booked food options weren't available. The reason I keep booking them because of low price compared to only other two options Cathay and Air India. Sad that Jet Airways went south and don't operate any aircraft now but their services were at par with cathay.
If you find cathay price is say 500$ - 1000$ more than Spice then go for that, it will be worth. Again is SpiceJet then only SPICEMAX can save you.

Spicejet has lately been my most preferred airlines. Let me share my very recent experience. I had booked 6 flights seats for my sister and cousins from NewDelhi to Mumbai. At airport check due to excess luggage they had to shuffle luggage to save extra charges which the check in officer patiently allow. Sister and cousins had 5 luggage’s however the mix up due to weight management in luggage they got tags for only 4 luggage’s and the fifth was left aside. At time of arrival 11pm night at Mumbai the group realised and notice to arrival luggage help desk about missing luggage. Since No tag it should be a No support excuse from Spice jet but they noted her address and assured will be found and delivered to her address. 
Midnight 3 am I get call from delhi airport Spicejet officer asking me about and luggage left behind and send me pics of the luggage and checking if its mine..which was luckily ours and we shared the lost luggage complaint receipt and glad they find it. The officer assured the luggage will be deliver to Mumbai in early morning flight..

Had worst experience!!!,Srigant,Chennai (Madras) - Bagdogra,"We had pretty bad experience with Spice Jet. Poor service at airport with fake promises. It has been almost a month now still I am behind spice Jet to get my refund amount.

And the response from the customer service is also really pathetic!!!

I sent a mail to customer service (below mail) and Check their reply, have attached screenshot.

Hi,
 
I had a booking with Spice Jet on December 9 2019 with PNR P9PBQP . I had my web check-in done and reached airport by 5:00AM in the morning.
 
Even after having my Web Check-in done the Spice Jet in charge person asked me to stand in the same line of the counter check in, which was a long queue.
 
Due to this when I reached the counter by 5:30 AM they said boarding is closed.
 
The issue was purely because of the irresponsible reply of the spice staff who asked me to stand in the check-in queue even after mentioning that I have a Web Check-in done.
 
After explaining these issues to the duty manager and we came to conclusion of partial refund of the money of ?4000 which was initiated by one named Meenu in the Spice Jet Airport office.
 
It has been almost 20 days now the amount has not been refunded when I contact the customer care they say only ?500 will be refunded as no proper message is updated in the portal.
 
The airport Spice Jet duty manager promised for an amount of ?4000 refund and now the customer care person says ?500 refund, this completely a disappointing service from Spice Jet Airways.
 
Already we had a bad trauma in the entire trip because of this and more over that now I am being slogged for the refund!!!!

Never again,AMS,Surat - Kolkata (Calcutta),"90% of my travels are with emirates, then Qatar, then Turkish so I don’t have much experience with low cost. However when I was checking flights Surat to Kolkata the price was approx 4000 Indian rupees then about 10 days before flight I checked again & it was 9000 rupees so I thought i better book it but this being India it wouldn’t accept my Uk RBS credit card so after a few hours I gave up , went to book it about a week before and it had gone up to 14000 rupees- what on earth is going on? To make sure of our tickets I paid them 28000 rupees- how can they keep jacking up prices? Surely they have published fares? Don’t think easyJet or Ryanair do this
To cap it all off the 3.15pm flight took off from Surat at almost 6pm teaching Kolkata in the dark and robbing us of a cosy get together with friends - so if can help it NEVER AGAIN with SPICEJET",Domestic,1.0,January 2020,6 January 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Comfortable flight,Pratap Venugopal,New Delhi - Shirdi,I along with my wife and son decided to visit Shirdi and accordingly took SpiceJet SG 946 from New Delhi  to Shirdi and return by SG 942 . During winters the flight leaves New Delhi around 13.50 hrs and the return flight takes of from Shirdi at 15:50 hrs the next day. The flights from both sides not only took off bang on time but also landed ahead of time! The interiors of the Boeing 737-800 had been spruced up the seats in rows of 3 were adequate for the flight of 1hour 50 mins duration and the two first rows have good leg space. The warm meals and beverages served were exceptionally good and the cabin crew were friendly attentive and very helpful. The boarding and disembarkation was smooth. Baggage was put on the belt at Shirdi almost as soon as we landed but on return to Delhi it took almost a little over an hour which was an unacceptable period and almost the duration of the flight.,Domestic,5.0,December 2019,5 January 2020,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Cheap price. Friendly but poorly trained staff regarding safety measures,Vishal P,Ahmedabad - Udaipur,"Not too many options so booked on spicejet 

Cheap price. Front desk told me that flight was delayed due to weather. Check in staff said it was because late arrival. Flight was delayed by just less then 2 hours. They did not offer any other options. 

In flight - was served with a tasty sandwich. 
Flight crew was ignorant about safety. My next seat passenger had his table tray out just before take off - crew member did their last walk by check and didnt see this. I had to explain why tray should be up during take off and landing. 
Many passengers had their seats reclined during take off and landing. Staff doesnt realize this is a hazard during sudden stopping and evacuation. 
Wonder if they ignore safety of planes also. 
Back of seat has safety signs hidden between advertisements- shows they probably would ignore safety for profit.

However the flight was further delayed was not at all intimated and good that I ate timely meals and had my dinner before boarding the flight

On board associates knew that the flight is been deferred and it’s almost 10.45 in night and their might be some patrons or boarder who are travelling with their teen-agers and folks might not have eaten or may have need of some sort of nourishment

I do recognize that they have limited meals on board and can’t oblige to any one except prior authorizations, however as curtsey they could have asked for tea, coffee or may be cookies to old generation and kids
They should have been considerate on this and could have eluded making cash on this, I have also mentioned this earlier but I think other feedback are more important than this

Motivated Team Member  Rakhi,SIMBA14C,Pune - Ahmedabad,"Our journey started with a bad note but Rakhi made up and ensured we had a pleasant experience
- When checking in at the counter we clearly requested for a reclining seat and which was confirmed by the counter lady it was reclining
- When we were at the counter one of the counter staff was rude and insulting to a traveller who probably has not had much of flying experience. 
- The staff need to realise there are other travellers around and who would draw a opinion which is what happened.
- On boarding we realised the seat was non reclining and imagine the frustration a passenger would go through
- On expressing displeasure to Rakhi she was highly apologetic and in a a few minutes as the flight was about to take off offered us seats which were reclining.
- We had the senior cabin crew member come to us and regretted the inconvenience 
- We were observing the attitude of Rakhi and must mention she seemed to be highly motivated and seem to be enjoying her work.

I suppose every organisation must have team member like Rakhi and that would be possible only if they are recognised and motivated. In service industry we need happy team members.

This was a disastrous flight,Rhea R,Mumbai - New Delhi,"I was travelling to Delhi with my family and my father is a senior citizen, his seat was not tilting so he requested to switch to another seat since some other seats in flight were empty to which a male crew obliged and showed him the way to another seat.After the plane took off my father realised that he forgot something on the previous seat and came to take it however what he didn't realise is that the seat belt sign was on and a female crew on seeing this began yelling at him and shouted that he can't understand simple things also. He said that he will definitely listen and understand but she should speak a little politely. To which she kept on yelling and didn't stop and we had to intervene saying that if he was quiet and seated she should stop yelling which didn't go down well with her. She then proceeded to move further and then argued with some other passengers at the front to which the other passengers stated that she was too rude and needed to speak in a better way. She was yelling to a point where the other crew had to request her to go back to her seat and she didn't come out for the rest of the flight.
This was just the start, the pilot then came on speaker and warned that all the passengers who were a part of the scene with this apparently HEAD air hostess would be deboarded at Ahmedabad which is a 2 hour diversion and the rest of the passengers would suffer but then they decided to keep the seat belt sign on so that no one would get up to question them. The seat belt sign stayed on through 70% of the journey with all passengers strapped in so that no one could get up. 
Though we all still cooperated and didn't see the air hostess or any message from the pilot through the rest of the flight.
As we landed we were relieved that this was over but sadly it didn't end. We realised that our one bag and another couple on flights' bags went missing at the belt with no ground staff from spice Jet in sight. They inquired at the front desk and told us that the staff was supposed to be attending the passengers. But no staff showed up for 1hour and 15mins and we kept trying at the front desk. After all the wasted time and effort a crew shows up and states that the bags will now arrive in the next flight and we could pick it up then.

"Late, and misleading announcements by Flight crew",Biswadeepam Pal,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"This is probably going to be my last flight at Spice Jet, SG-272 had my worst experience ever, now the flight has been delayed but i have been on delayed flights before this but this takes it to new heights because my flight was to depart at 9:25 but I received notification that it was going to depart at 1:45 pm at 11:15 am which was already 2 hours after the original departure time, thats going to be an inconvenience because I am definitely not going to bath and get fresh at the airport. All other flights namely indigo were departing at their times normally only spice jet planes somehow didn't take off, thats just so problematic. Then again I received a message on my phone at 1 pm that it was going to take off at 2:30 then finally it took off at 3pm. When we landed the crew were least bothered to know the belt number the luggage is going to be available at, they said it was going to be at belt-8 but it was available at 9 which i found out on enquiring separately, after waiting almost 15-20 minutes at Belt-8 which stopped.

think twice about using this airline if you are older and/or require special assistance,BykeRyde,Mangalore - Newark,"This is regarding the travel related to SpiceJet flight SG 59 taken on Dec 28 2019, departing Mangalore at 12:20 a.m., arriving to Dubai at 2:30 a.m. (final destination: Newark, NJ).  My father and I are both US citizens and we were returning back to the US after one week in South India (our flight path was taking SpiceJet from Mangalore to Dubai then Emirates from Dubai to Newark).  Because of his age and related health issues my father had requested wheelchair service, which has NEVER been an issue or problem with other airlines.  SpiceJet and its associates handled this request EXTREMELY poorly in both Mangalore and Dubai.

Mansoor (I think that is how is name is spelled), a SpiceJet agent in Mangalore, was nice and courteous but unfortunately he was not around when the following occurred.  My father and I had requested that his wheelchair be brought to the waiting area after immigration and security.  This did not happen for quite a period of time, despite several guarantees I received from one of the SJ agents.  After waiting and waiting, my father became frustrated and decided to walk to the gate rather than wait for his promised wheelchair.  It is sadly surprising that an airline handles those requiring assistance in this manner.

It became even worse after we arrived in Dubai.  Upon arrival, my father was escorted off the plane by a SpiceJet agent named Kunal (I do not know if this is his first name or last name but the Dubai airport duty official made some phone calls and found out that this was his name).  Kunal left my father with a wheelchair attendant at the exit of the aircraft and started walking up the exit bridge towards the airport.  I was standing at the end, waiting for my father.  I noticed that the wheelchair attendant did not take my father's duffel bag with him when he started the transport.  This bag is very crucial and must remain with my father at all times, for medical purpose and financial purposes.  As the attendant started transporting my father, I noticed another individual (not sure if they were associated with the airline or airport) reaching for the bag as though they were going to sneak it.  I became very alarmed and concerned and loudly said ""The bag !  Get the bag !  You're forgetting the bag !  Please get the bag, it can't just be left there, he can't be without it !""  The wheelchair attendant didn't understand English, and Kunal (who was standing at the exit of the bridge into the airport) started sharply shouting at me ""Say please, ok ?  Don't be rude.  You are not in India anymore.  Don't talk to me like that.""  I said ""I'm sorry.  He needs his bag though, it can't just be left there.""  He shouted and repeated what he had said a second time, including additional insults about being Indian and being Hindu.  I was shocked and stunned.  I could not believe an agent of ANY airline would have such a gunshot and harsh reaction to what is seemingly a simple request, that is please don't forget my father's bag (the wheelchair attendant had no idea that he had forgotten my father's bag).  Kunal was attacking, inappropriate, out of line, and discriminatory.  This was my first time flying with SpiceJet, I have only traveled with Air India before when traveling to or within India.  SpiceJet provided my father and I with a very distasteful and discouraging experience.

I am strongly advising friends and relatives that require assistance when traveling of this incident, and to think twice and thrice before traveling with this airline.",International,1.0,December 2019,30 December 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

No update on flight status display, it was updated as 'Boarding' then 'Closed' (after 45 mins) but actually there was no boarding. Staff is non-responsive, first of all, they should teach them how to talk to customer and provide up-to-date flight status.
2. Most of the passengers are first time traveler in this flight. Passengers don't know where to seat, front raw passengers went to last raw and vice versa (boarding was not as per row sequence), crew were unable to handle the situation. It took 65 mins for boarding the flight (in addition to 1.5 hrs.)
3. Toilets were overflow, not clean and stink in the flight.
4. Most of the seat's recliner is not working. There is minimum leg space between two seats (except SpiceMax, first 4 rows, with additional cost of INR 2500/seat), if front seat is reclined and your seat is not reclined then it will 100% broke your nose and chin.
5. Only in SpiceJet, there is no auto luggage transfer between International/Domestic sector. Passenger should manually transfer the luggage; this is most unconvinced.

Most of the passengers carrying extra weight as they had purchased lot of stuff from duty free. N airline auth announced that they will be charging almost 300 Dirhams for 5 kgs. Insane..
Either the cabin baggage should have checked in the beginning. Or else what is the use of duty free to customers travelling on Spicejet?
 or this policy of Company should  have been clearly told while issuing the ticket..so at least passenger prepare themselves accordingly.
To be very frank no one really have so much interest nor time to go thru each and every sentence written on the rules on website of company. Also people book tickets via some booking app causing unnecessary harassment to the traveller.

3. Passanger should not be disturbed during inflight F&B services, while he/she is sleeping, rather passanger may be given his /her F&B supplies as parcel either at the time of landing or at the time he/she wakeup.

3. For long distance flights, cabin lights should be dimmed to minimul permissible level, or otherwise customer have the privilege to use/ switch-on the individual lamp placed right above each seat.

4. During inflight, Plastic packaging/Serving Materials must not be used or should be used marginally where it's inevitable to replace plasit with other eco-friendly packaging /serving materials.

Pune-Goa-Pune,AUG1978,Pune - Goa,"The airline, its aircraft & staff are great, no complaints. The issue is with the sector. 
The Pune Goa flight departs at 12:20 & although the scheduled arrival in Goa is 13:30, it is usually before time. Problem arises when you are travelling with kids as you have to skip a meal. Even if you pre-book the meal, the flying time is so less that by the time the cabin crew hands out the meals, the pilots announces descent (tray tables closed).

Spicejet - Pathetic Customer Service!,Suneel Yadav,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"I have a travel experience from multiple airlines, where Spicejet was the worst and from that day I haven't booked a single Spicejet flight even the prices for Spicejet flight are just half, compare to others are offering.

Due to some emergency, I had to travel BLR - DEL by flight ✈️ and then need to take other transport 🚐🚌 to travel more than 6 hours from delhi, this was an overnight journey. 

Due to time constraints, I didn't got a chance to eat anything and was arriving to airport at last minute. By keeping that in my mind I had booked the food 🍝 of my choice in Spicejet flight (online). When it comes to serving the food, staff 👩‍✈️came and told that all food has been finished and they don't have what I have ordered, and staff handed over me a business card 📇 by stating that if you want you can make a complaint about this. I told them that the food I had ordered was for my hunger not for complaints, where should I go now. Staff was having only one answer, please take the business card and make the complainant, we can't do anything now.

Point is - if you are taking any order, then why can't fullfill that and if can't fullfill stop taking orders online. No one is interested to book that dam costly, tasteless food for travel. We are booking only when there is a much need. Try to keep yourself as a place of customer and then imagine.

The Self Checkin kiosk would crash most of the times. Then I stood in a long queue; after standing in the queue for half an hour I feel that I might miss the flight, so I enquire. It turns out that there's a seperate queue for Varanasi flight but none of the passengers are aware of it. Upon arguing with them, they realize and make an announcement and around 30-40 customers, who were also waiting in the long queue like me, line up for the Varanasi counter.

Worst experience ever,808rajeshkumar,Patna - Chennai (Madras),"I was flying from Patna to Chennai on 3rd Dec. First of all flight was delayed for around an hour and no prior information. I got to know only when I reached airport. It was horrible experience to collect boarding pass from counter. It was long queue of almost 200 people and staff were not well trained to handle it.

I asked for a masala tea. She told me that your turn will come soon and then we will come at your seat with trolley and serve you, she came after almost 30 minute after serving everyone. I handed over her 500 rs for a tea and sandwiche. She did not returned my 200 rs remaining. I was still waiting. However I end up asking at the time of arrival. The guy was apologetic and he returned my 20p rs. After first incident I thought of trying 2nd time which was also bad. The boing had TV screen I asked attendant to help me out.

Do not fly SpiceJet! Worst customer service EVER,Caroline C,Mumbai - Kochi (Cochin),"I flew with SpiceJet from Mumbai to Kochi: where to even begin with how horrible this airline is! Our problems started at the check-in desk, where the woman checking us in visibly rolled her eyes at us when we approached the counter. From that moment, I knew we would have problems. When we arrived in Kochi, I was informed that my bag had been kept in Mumbai because of a powerbank (which the check-in lady did NOT ask us about). Now, I completely understand why they have this policy, and that's not the problem I had with SpiceJet, as I realize that part is my fault. The problem was how SpiceJet customer service handled it. No information, hanging up on me every time I called to check the status of my bag, needing me to send the appropriate paperwork MULTIPLE TIMES before removing the powerbank and sending me my bag (which took over 48 hours). I honestlydon't understand why it's so difficult to simply remove the powerbank (which I gave permission to do) and send the bag. Yet for some reason, the people who work for this airline are completely incompetent. 

Not only that, but I received a message on WhatsApp that my bag was arriving on a certain flight, so I drove 1.5 hours to pick it up. But when I arrived, the bag WAS NOT ON THE FLIGHT! Instead, it was on the next flight which landed 3 hours later. Since we were about to leave Kochi and go to Alleppey, I had to wait for it. I spoke with the people working at the SpiceJet counter in Kochi airport, who didn't seem to care at all and kept saying ""well maybe it will come tomorrow"". I made it clear I wasn't leaving without the bag, and told them I'd wait for the next flight. I left to get some food, and when I returned, NO ONE WAS THERE -- the counter was closed. Fortunately I was able to get the terminal manager to help me get my bag, but if they weren't going to be there, why the hell didn't they just say so when I told them I'd be returning?? Truly a horrendous experience with SpiceJet customer service, both in person and on the phone -- completely unhelpful in every way possible. 

The second time we flew SpiceJet was no better, as we were charged double the price of our ticket to change our flight by one day (even though online it says you only have to pay the difference of the fares, which is a lie). On top of that, there were over $100 of hidden fees added to the ticket price, which we were not informed about until it was time to pay. We were told we either had to pay it, or we'd lose our current flight AND the new reservation. Nothing about this airline makes sense, worst customer service I've ever experienced.

As our seat no.were 3A nd 3B , there was an extra leg- room which made the journey very comfortable.
Nd the most fantastic part was at the baggage - claim counter ... our luggage had priority tags ... so we got our bags in the very first round itself.
So nice experiences !!!

What we didn't like -
No , I don't hv anything 2 write about in this segment.

We had the same gr8 comfortable experience in both our journeys .

Yes ... I recommend ... spend some extra money nd b Spicemax travellers nd travel with a soothing feeling .

So while concluding , I will repeat .. Don't hesitate .. Go for Spicemax

Horrible service and poor club membership rules,SAMRAJ KIRUBAHA... B,Chennai (Madras) - Goa,"I was unable to create a club membership due to an error ""Service not connected status code: Internal Server Error"". I raised it multiple times through email and their pedestrian IT team was unable to solve. Finally I solved it myself as I am an IT professional and created the account.

I asked them to credit the miles for the journey done last month. It was because their website has been programmed to return only ""Name mismatch"" whenever you try to get miles credited by providing a PNR number. Whatever you give, it will tell ""Name mismatch"". I called their customer care who refused to credit the miles stating that it is their ""policy"". They don't have a full customer view and do not know that in Indian conditions people write their names in different ways. Because they don't want any miles to be credited to any account.

To the outside world they want to show that they have a club membership program. Their club account also does not allow to add family members who are born after 2002. This means they don't consider your full family.

Booked the ticket on Sep21 2019, to return on Dec1st and timing was 14.45PM
All of sudden timings was revised to 10.10 AM.
Now the option is either board or refund or choose some other day
When called customer care, i asked for some discounts on hotel booking, because of timings changed i need to stay in island. First  i got answer as a seperate team will contact and help out
And then nodal officer a lady name Ruchi (she is poison), said you agreed to terms and conditons and we cannot offer any hotel.
Now after paying money , i need to succumb to this bladi rascals....
I cannot board @ 10.10 AM. if i go for refund i need to pay convenience charges, which is 250 + taxes per head(we were two ppl) and need to pay extra money for other flights tickets.

Simply keeping the terms and conditions as a weapon to shut the mouth of the passengers and disrespecting passengers and cheating their money.....I sincerely pray to lord of death to ring the death bell for this airline soon...... as  it happened for BSNL

and today dec 2nd ..timing was 10.10 AM whereas flight took off @ 11.15 AM ....

I had already booked another one standing on the aisle in the flight... Now I don't trust the airline so I booked one after 12am reached railway station around 11:30 pm...reached 4hour late at home..

Terrible,arnabdipika,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bengaluru,"My advice is to avoid this airline as best as you can. If you don’t have any options then opt for Indian Railway.
Now why I am saying so...

1. I have not seen any airlines to weigh the cabin baggage, not even International airlines like Emirates and Qatar airline. Personally I have travelled 4 times with Qatar to USA. 
On other hand SpiceJet actually weighed my cabin baggage & my laptop bag and charged me for every single gram of that is overweight. I felt like I have been caught by traffic police and it seems those crews in counter has a target set for squeezing money. They were utterly misbehaved. Disgustingly arrogant.  
As if “customer care”??? Go to hell. 

2. As usual the flight was delayed by 1hour but eventually instead of arriving to BLR at 7.45PM it reached at 9.10PM . And basically it killed the very own reason for choosing this flight, and it ruined by rest of the evening. Eventually reached home at 11.45PM. Thanks to great service by SpiceJet.

When I tweeted they said I quote
“We always try our best to maintain the departure time as per the schedule. However, at times, due to unavoidable reasons, we face delay. We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused.” 
So they are sorry that’s it and every trouble we faced has been washed away. 

So I could have also said that regarding my excess baggage “My overweight in cabin baggage was due to unavoidable reason , and I am sorry for the inconvenience caused to the flight” 

3. Once you enter the flight you will feel you entered in world of advertisement. The interior itself is a walking marketing metal
Box. Similar like F1 car driver with all logos sticking out from their costumes. Everywhere there are ads. 

This is the last time I am flying with this nauseating spicy red. 

Please avoid SpiceJet it worst of the worst.

Room For Improvement,Ajit_N_Kulkarni,Mumbai - Dhaka City,"Mumbai Dhaka flight SG 77  was to leave from Mumbai at 8.55 am on 18th Nov19. 

It means one has to reach 180min before as per rule means at airport at 5.55am. It means one has to start 1 hr early from home or hotel means starting point can be 4.55am. Considering to complete morning routine one has to wake up 1 hr before means 4 am can be waking up. 

He or she becomes ready and suddenly gets message that flight is delayed to 10.50 am. So waiting and or starts for airport. 

After reaching airport and checking-in, one gets message that flight delayed to 11.40am but courtsey shown to give breakfast. Gate declared is now changed. Again waiting period starts and suddenly gets message flight further delayed to 12.50pm and lunch will be served. So for taking lunch again walk up and long way and come back. 

Meantime people gets irritated, few started talking with manager to confirm timing which is not answered properly. Then 1.45pm was new given time. Which was then postopnded to 3.30 pm. 
Now patience of people went off. There were lot of children, their parents go t annoyed. Lot of business people who had arranged meetings, for them it was problem. Their schedule went off. 
Everything was unkown scenario, disorder, total chaos. Surprisingly no ground staff or manager was there who could correctly tell what was issue, when this flight going to take off, is it going to take off. One gentleman staff was just saying now it will be taking off. But it went as false assurance. 

Please understand the gravity of situation that people who have woke up at 4am and planned their day for going to native place or on tour or for business or any urgent work are having no clue whatsoever if they can go or not. It will be better for airline to understand the scenario of peoples's mind and needs to improve upon such situation, which any time should not happen. Airline can think upon making alternate arrangement on humanitirian ground in such situation.

I feel like they operate just to torture passengers. They never get air traffic clearance to land, so wherever you are flying be ready to hover over at least for an extra hour.

Dear Sir/Mam,

I flew From Tir-Bom on 23/10/2019 From SG6451.

I regret to mention that your flight experience was very addictive. The hole experience was so awesome that it would not allow me to travel any other airlines henceforth. The team lead by IFM- Shanti was great and made the flight experience very comfortable.

My special thanks to Bharti who was very professional and polite to all the needs of the flyers as I was watching. 

Also, other crew members Maria and Naslif were equally good.

Just like to conclude saying ""The airline is only as good as the front-line staff, they are truly what makes Spicejet- Unforgettable""

Warm Regards

One of my worst flight experiences,Mike G,Varanasi - Mumbai,"Flight operation from Varanasi to Mumbai

I try to summarise my experience in short :

I had booked for 4 persons in advance, incl wheelchair service. Somebody from Spicejet customer service in Delhi/Gurgeon called me immediately after my booking by offering me an upgrade for all in the name of "" Spicemax""...means/involving : priority boarding, free of charge meal service on board, extra large seat with more space. Additional costs : INRS 4,076 . I accepted this offer and paid by credit card.
....and this was reality:
---we appeared at the airport 2 hours before scheduled departure in the evening on november 5th ,2019
----wheelchair service was available immediately
---first surprise at airport entry : whilst Spicejet tells you to avoid print of booking confirmation Indian police insists on prints and refuses entry if not provided.
----second surprise at luggage check in counter : this airline allows only 15 kg luggage plus 7 kg handluggage. We paid for 15kg excess , multiplied by INRS 400/kg ....in total INRS 6,000
--- third surprise : Spicejet could not provide Spicemax-service due to change of plane now. They promised, however, refund of my extra paid 4,076 via my credit card....I am curious whether it will happen.
---security check normal according to indian standard
---boarding procedure : we were waiting patiently for the wheelchair service...nobody came . So I had to call for this assistance again for not being left behind.
---the plane itself was an old B 737-800...dirty, small,... hardly acceptable
----4 stewardesses on board , but instead of being available to service guests they rushed through the plane and only distributed pre-ordered meals....not even mineral water served for other passengers during the whole flight but instead sitting behind the curtain and doing nothing .
----I nearly forgot :unnecessary hectic before take off: everybody was asked to show boarding pass again...apparently for security reasons.
----additional remark : the crew existed of two Indian and two Turkish stewardesses and especially the two Turkish ones proved to be extremely unpolite towards some flight-guests. Besides ,those two made jokes about the indian ones and this left an additional bad impression of Spice Jet.
Sorry to say : it was my first and last experience with the indian airline SPICE JET.",Domestic,1.0,N/A,12 November 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

After calling me over 10 times with all the promises I booked the spice max upgrade. We had pre booked meals 2 months in advance for all hot meals. The disappointment started at the check in when they said that 3 seats are not spice max but we would get meals. They would refund the spice max amount. After we boarded when meals were being served they informed us that no meals are booked for us. We showed them the ticket with all the dishes mentioned, he informed us that it is not showing in our sheet. After many arguments he gave some sandwiches. The spice max seat at window was broken and the handle was cut and poking in the leg. We brought to the notice of cabin crew and we requested for a blanket or cushion to avoid the pain but they said they didnt have any. Once we got off the flight, I complained to the Ground staff Mr Karandeep who was extremely casual about  it and said meals are not even reflecting for return flight and you have not paid for the meals inspite of showing him the meals mentioned on the ticket.

I came last in the flight and the all the cabin crew members where so happy to help. When I entered the airbus, I have not found any space to keep my bag so then one crew member came her name was HERLEEN KAUR, I saw on her face, she actually trying so hard to solve my problem. Bcs the bag size is not that much small we can adjust anywhere. So at the end she put my bag on her bag’s space. Thank you to the HERLEEN KAUR that initially helped, during the flight she was so positive with me and spreading happiness around Also thank you to the SpiceJet. At the time of food service when she is serving I really don’t want to eat anything bcs I usually prefer non-veg and when she asked me I said Do you have Biryani she replied with yes Sir Veg Biryani then I Smiled and said Thank you but I like the way how she asked me again Would you like to have some coffee they I really like the way she ask me so I ordered  Cappuccino it was nice. This was the first time I experienced this in the flight usually I used to go to sleep on airbuses bcs I hate flights. The staff on this flight were brilliant and a credit to spicejet.

I normally take the early web-check-in option, but the system would not let me check-in without first paying and securing a seat.  I refuse to pay for a seat on an aircraft.  This was the only irritating feature of the SpiceJet web-check-in.

Baggage Lost on International Flight - Apathy by Spicejet,Gaurav G,New Delhi - Bangkok,"We lost our Checked-in Baggage travelling from Delhi to Bangkok.

On losing my baggage:

1. I found out that there is no representative from Spicejet on Bangkok Airport to report the issue.

2. On my own after running around, I found out the Baggage Handling partner.

3. I coordinated on my own with that Partner with difficulty, as the employees are not well versed in Basic English.

4. I registered complaint with them in writing, after running from pillar to post taking over an hour. 

5. In the process I missed my pre-booked transportation to Pattaya (where I was travelling) and had to take a cab on-the-spot.

I received my baggage afterwards coordinating with Baggage Handling partner.

Spicejet remained clueless, if I received my bag or not.

I went through Severe Mental Trauma, as I was travelling with my wife and 3 yr old kid.

Then we requested one air hostess to find out about our further plan. And she informed that it would take off after 25/30 minutes.

I was offered the following in this package:

1. Priority Check-in : It was fulfilled 
2. Priority Security : It was fulfilled for me but for my wife, there was a long queue with more ladies from economy class passing security.
3. 2 x 2 first row seats : We got First row but only 3 x 3 seats. At the time of taking Spice Max services, I was specifically told about 2 x 2 seats. In fact these 3 x 3 front row seats are cramped since between two seats, folding table is also accommodated. So this was a negative point plus the folding table was broken and was not able to hold itself during use.

Vast improvement,Anand G,Mumbai - Kochi (Cochin),"There is vast improvement from the past in the quality of service. They fly without much delay (Spice Jet was an unpredictable airline till a couple of years back) and have well groomed cabin crew. However, the upkeep of the aircraft needs a lot of improvement. That the seat pocket did not even have the safety card in it was a shocker. Later I realized that it is not the negligence of those who are responsible for this but the condition of the seat pocket itself. Anything kept in the seat pocket falls through to the floor as the bottom is found torn completely. I brought this to the notice of a cabin crew, not as a complaint but as an advice, and he was smart enough to have a new safety card, air sickness bag etc inserted into a large plastic pouch and made sure that the same will not fall through; he also promised me that he will take up the issue with the maintenance department.

Totally unprofessional and terrible airline,Shib Bhowmik,Pune - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I took their SG517 on 9th October scheduled departure at 3.45 pm. The aircraft got some technical issues after reaching Bengaluru. They asked us ( about 9 passengers going to Kolkata) to deplane. A customer service rep took us along but we had to wait at a Security gate for more than 15 minutes because CISF was not informed as per protocol.
The flight took off after 10.30 pm from Bengaluru well after 4 hours delay. 
I had a front row aisle seat but while boarding at Bengaluru the representative changed my seat to 17A . When I objected and mentioned that I paid Rs.1200 for the seat the girl then gave me a front row window seat- this is without giving any reason. The aircraft was of same configuration so it was surprising that they changed my seat even when my boarding card mentioned my original purchased seat. After boarding I found that my front row aisle seat was not occupied at all. The hostess then sold/ upgraded another passenger to this seat. I had to suffer because I had pain in my left leg.

After we landed in Kolkata to our horror we found out that our luggage didn’t arrive in Kolkata and all the luggage of passengers who came from Pune was left behind in Bengaluru. 
It was already 2.00 am and there was only one representative at the Kolkata airport and it was utter confusion....
I left the airport after taking a receipt and when I phoned the Kolkata airport next morning the SpiceJet rep informed that the suitcase arrived by another flight around 4.am but the luggage delivery person will join only at 10 AM and then they will take action to deliver the luggage- there was absolutely no urgency.
All the perishable items in my luggage will be wasted and my essential medicines is already causing difficulties.. most of these disruptions and problems were totally avoidable if SpiceJet was responsible and accountable to passengers.
In the last few months I have noticed several unusual delays from SpiceJet. This airline will be my absolute last resort and would never ever take one of their flight if I would have any urgency.",Domestic,1.0,October 2019,9 October 2019,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

pay for the services and forgot to get them,Kanika C,Shirdi - New Delhi,"Most unprofessional staff. we got our e-boarding passes but they have no system to check that. so you need to get boarding passes again from shirdi itself. Even i was called number of times to get spice smart for priority check in but no priority was given. no one even bother to greet you. when we told we have priority boarding they deny and said it was till you get the passes not applicable for boarding.the person standing was so damn rude despite the fact we have a senior citizen with us he make us stand last in the queue. the tone he use was so abusive and after giving boarding passes he stopped us by saying not all boarding passes is there. after a argument when i kept urging him to check his hand, he saw he already have all the passes in his hand. despite this rubbish attitude he didn't bother to say sorry. the air crew was again too much way below average. They were not at all checking the list to whom they should provide meal. we already have pre-booked meal but still they provide us meal after we asked for it as they were too busy selling the food to those who were paying them at that time. when we asked for certain things they said they are out of those items as people already took them. they were suppose to make us the priority but they were busy with selling items and there was a family member of one of the staff. so all the attention was given to them instead of any one else in the flight. the staff was flirting with each other and was not at all bother to greet and serve. worst crew and worst flight experience.",Domestic,1.0,September 2019,8 October 2019,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Unprofessional and irresponsible attitude of SpiceJet airlines,Suraj,New Delhi - Guwahati,"This is not the first time I am facing such a reckless and irresponsible attitude from this airliner. Owing to my long route, I had split my journey from Uttarkhand to Guwahati into two, former being through bus (Uttarkahand to Delhi) and the latter through flight (Delhi to Guwahati). I had scheduled the flight in way that would be plausible for me to board on to after reaching Delhi by choosing the spicejet flight SG-231 (11:25 am-01:35 pm). Though I was sceptical about their commitment but I thought that they must have improved by now. But to my surprise today (07/10/2019) I got a call, a message and an email, all of them being shoved down my throat forcibly that my flight had been changed due to the introduction of their 'Winter Schedule' from 09:25 am to 2:55 am via kolkata without any other alterntaive being presented to me. Now its impossible for me to catch the flight from Delhi and also a hassle for me to find cab in Guwahati. Nowhere have they mentioned even any alternative to choose from. This is not the first time they did this. It has happened to me twice before. In the first case they had changed the time of my connecting flight and I had to wait for 2 hours without any sort of penalty levied upon them. Moreover when enquired over the issue the person on their counter shunned me away by saying that it was my responsibility to catch it on time (I literally ran for the connecting flight the moment I landed). The second time they cancelled my flight together just a few days before and I had to pay double the price for which they were not penalised either and didnt bother to reimburse the price differnece. I am uterly appalled by their attitude towards the cutomers and their sheer and stern response over such cases. They should'nt change the flights at the first place. Are there novices handling the reservtions behind the bench? Don't commit at the first place if you can't abide by it, so that we can choose other able ailiners. To add to it they are not in the mitest of a chance embarassed over their incompetence and thus are never concerned to provide the customer a well suited alternative and reimbursement for the hassle caused. Its time the authorities take actions against them and avoid such unprofessional players from tainting the calm and managed environment of the airlines. I vehemently discourage the usage of this airliner.

Scam,Dileep Kumar,Dubai - Pune,"Guys beware of this spicejet airline, they are running a scam. I recently took flight from Dubai to pune and I can't believe what great cheats they are. First they are taking undue advantage of your situation and charging heavily for any excess baggage (approx 1400 inr per kg). I paid 15k for my excess baggage and they did that for most passengers and later all of our baggage was left behind as they did not have enough space in the flight and no information was provided to us. They just keep making money by accepting all there is to take. Upon landing in pune  like shameless people they informed us what they have done and delivered lot of false promises about refunds and compensation to pacify all. Later when I followed up with their customer care first few day they didn't even bother to reply; cause u know they already got the money and later when I complained again they bluntly refused to pay any compensation or refunds. 
They are extremely unprofessional and liars and cheats. Don't fall for their scams like me and from my experience I will tell you better to pay 1000 bucks extra and travel with other airline who don't do all this monkey business and have better professionalism.

Beware International Passengers - Cheating by manipulating the total weight of the bags,Lakshmi,Madurai - Boston,"I traveled from Madurai to Boston by SG612 which leaves at 8PM with a connection at Chennai that night, with my 8 year old daughter.

I had weighed all my 4 bags at home and the total was less than 90kgs.  In fact, one of the 4 check in bags was small (typical carryon) and was only 19kgs.  When I checked in at Madurai airport, the front desk person weighed all bags together and said they total to 96kgs.  I told him I had weighed them at home and they were less than 90kgs.  He refused and said they four weigh 96kgs.  He gave me discount and asked me to pay Rs.2000 towards excess baggage.  I was delayed and got worried that may be my weighing machine at home was wrong and paid the extra Rs.2000.  But when I checked in my bags at Chennai airport for my international flight, the 4 bags together weighed only 88.8 kgs.  I was shocked to realize that the front desk person at Madurai airport had cheated me.  I am not sure if it is the attitude of the person at the front desk towards international passengers or SpiceJet instructing them to do so.

Ridiculous service,b1003804,Leh - New Delhi,"The airplane delayed and delayed after we got airport. Finally we can't catch our next airplane. The most ridiculous thing is THE STAFF REFUSED TO GIVE US DELAY CERTIFICATE UNTIL WE PROMISED THAT WE WILL USE IT FOR OUR OWN TRAVEL INSURANCE IN OUR COUNTRY .
Another ridiculous thing is when we ask the first staff for giving us the delay certificate, he ask us ""wait for 20 minutes"" . Then 20 minutes later, HE WAS OFF. So we need to ask for another new staff and explain whole things again.
We spent more than 1 hour to get a certificate.

Another thing is they destroyed my luggage wheel. But when I ask for compensate, they want me to wait again. I have no time because I need to catch another flight. I don't know if a delay certificate could take more than one hour, how long does it take for a luggage compensate for Spice jet?
Is that the India style staff ?? Or Spice jet style?? Or both?

班機在我們到達機場後，才一再延遲，最後延遲了兩個多小時，導致我們無法搭上原班轉機的飛機。
當我們要求延遲證明時，香料航空的員工問了很多問題，一直不肯開證明，直到我對他保證我們是要申請國內保險，並且不會要他們負責。
更可笑的是，我們第一次向香料航空的服務人員申請證明時，服務人員要我們「等待20分鐘」。然後二十幾分鐘後，他消失了，因為他下班了。我們只好詢問另一個接班的服務人員，並且從頭解釋一次狀況。
此外我的行李輪子被摔斷，但是當我要求賠償時，他們說要等。我們申請延遲證明就花費了超過一小時，我不曉得行李賠償需要多久，而且我必須去趕另一班飛機，所以後來香料航空沒有賠償我任何東西。",Domestic,1.0,August 2019,14 September 2019,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,N/A

They were flying a borrowed aircraft from Jet & the legroom was better compared to Indigo. The arrival terminal was the International one at Mumbai. They did not make any prior announcement about this (I guess they were using the Jet slot) which is unprofessional, in my opinion. Some may not approve the dress code of the on-board crew(I wouldn't want to comment on that). The service was pleasant, otherwise. On-time performance was worse than Indigo. Between Indigo & SpiceJet my preference is for Indigo for better professionalism. One thing I liked about them was the online booking experience.

Highly unsatisfied and displeased,shwetaj87,New Delhi - Mumbai,"Highly unsatisfied and very displeased with how Spicejet has handled the situation with my luggage on a recent flight I took from Delhi to Mumbai. My baggage was withheld in Delhi for a prohibited item (coconut) and I was asked to sign an authorization letter so that they could unlock my bag and I did that before taking the flight from Delhi. As the boarding had almost finished they said my bag couldn't be sent on the flight I was taking but will surely be sent on the next flight which was at 3.50pm. I was also told that I will be contacted and informed about the same. At 6.05pm I was at the Mumbai airport trying to find out where my bag was and whether it had been sent from Delhi. I didnt get any communication what so ever from Spicejet. I went to the spicejet desk at Terminal 1 and they said bag had been received, went to Arrivals as suggested but bag was not found. I called customer care for spicejet and that guy, Navneet told me my bag was still in clearance in Delhi and that I needed to send the authorization letter so that it could be released. He gave me a WhatsApp number and I messaged the authorization letter again, getting no response still what so ever. I was again told my bag would be sent on the 8.30 or 8.50pm flight from Delhi and would reach Mumbai by 10.45pm but that didnt happen either. I called customer care again to check the status as still nothing was communicated from Spicejet. This time they told me bag had been cleared now and that it would be sent by the next flight and would reach at 1.45am and that I would be contacted the following morning about the status. I received no communication or information or any kind of status on where my bag is even till the next morning. My cousin who went to pick up the bag the next day again contacted the terminal staff in Mumbai but didnt get any confirmation on the bag, had to wait at the airport for 45 mins before he finally got my bag. My bag is now in the worst condition possible. It was a new bag that I had just purchased from Delhi and now it is all black and dirty from everywhere. This situation has been handled by Spicejet in the worst possible way. Mumbai staff was not aware of what's happening in Delhi and vice versa and asked me to communicate with either side, where it should have been taken care of by the Spicejet staff. I have never experienced such atrocity with any other airlines.

Avoid this airline!!!,jsliu1,Dhaka City - New Delhi,"Really bad service from their office to the actual plane itself.  I had a mishap where my company misbooked the flight for the wrong day, the office admin and I went to the Spice Jet Office in Dhaka and they were absolutely useless.  It was surprising how incompetent and distant they were.  All I wanted to do was to change the day of the flight to a different day.  They suggested we call up the Spice Jet in India.  The irony was that I was in the Spice Jet office in Dhaka.  Why the Dhaka office couldn't call up the New Dehli office shows how uncoordinated and cheap this entire company is.    There was no offer to help nor did they allow us to use the phone to call up Spice Jet.  Seriously, what the hell?  I didn't have a sim card and the office admin was running low on his minutes, so we were forced to go back to the office and call up Spice Jet from there.  Thankfully, I was able to change my iternary to the right day.  When I got on the plane, I had to use the bathroom and the toilet seat had pee all over it.  It was disgusting.  (Since I used the bathroom before take off, I assume I was one of the first people to use that facility.  They didn't even clean it off.)  Although it was a 2.5 hour flight, it felt like eternity.

WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER FLOWN!!!,katybrandon62,New Delhi - Bangkok,"We travel 11 months out of the year, so my husband and I do A LOT of flying with different airlines. During our 7 week Asia trip, we decided to fly from Bangkok to Delhi and then Delhi back to Bangkok. It was frustrating enough for them to screw us over on the way to India, but not surprisingly, they screwed us over AGAIN flying out of Delhi. 
We paid for first class, top of the line, Spice Max seats. For both flights, they ""changed aircrafts"" and sat us in basic economy. What we were trying to understand was...okay but we still paid for first class....so even though the aircraft is different, why can't we still be in first class? Their answer? THEY COULDN'T EVEN GIVE US ONE.
As if that wasn't bad enough, the lady working the priority counter at the Delhi airport for our flight back to Bangkok was extremely rude. Like, the worst service I have ever experienced in any airline. I tried explaining our situation to her several times and she would not ever let me even get a single word out. She constantly interrupted me, refused to answer my questions and raised her voice at me when I never once raised mine at her. She was clearly unprofessional and inexperienced in the service business. I wish I could have grabbed her name, but I was so upset in the moment that I didn't even bother to look at her name tag. But, if SpiceJet reads this, she was working at the priority counter at 1:00 PM on August 25th. 
I normally hate calling people out, but it was such an upsetting experience working with her.

So now, i am going to jot down the points as to what are the inconveniences and trouble she had while travelling in SpiceJet flight i.e. from Bangalore to Hyderabad during 2019:
1. Shortage of wheelchairs and staff negligence/careless behavior to help senior citizen like my mother who needed assistance
2. Constant reminders and follow up to the check in counter to allocate wheelchair as they made her walk from entrance till boarding pass issue counter
3. Instead of arranging wheelchair, they asked my mother to walk till boarding the flight as there was a shortage of wheelchair without even asking her medical condition
4.Non professional behavior of the cabin crew and wheelchair boy to assist senior citizens, not even apologetic to the flyer for their flaws
5. Untidy seats and again constant reminders to provide wheelchair once landed the destination. I would warn and request everyone those who are challenged or senior citizens who opts for wheelchair to travel in SpiceJet at their OWN RISK.

Thumbs down to the management for not realizing their mistakes and hiring some stupid manner-less staffs. Please improve your services else, your business will be shut down too in the near future.",Domestic,1.0,January 2019,7 August 2019,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0
Stranded without luggage,Jill Barb,Dubai - Pune,We arrived in PNQ from DXB on 4th Aug & aft an hour were informed our luggage will arrive after 3 to 4 days. It's been 2 days we are stranded without our basic necessities in Pune and have to buy everything. Spicejet isn't taking responsibility for this inconvenience nor offering any assistance or compensation for this. This is not my story but also the story of 26 other passengers who traveled that night from DXB to PNQ. The worst experience  Spicejet needs to compensate all the passengers for the inconvenience they have put us through and bear our expenses for clothes and other necessities.,International,1.0,August 2019,7 August 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worse Airline ever,Iker,Jaisalmer - Ahmedabad,"I took two flights with Spiceje and both had 4 hours delay! One of them becuase of...
Problems with the engine! 

During the waiting we didn't know neither if the flight was going to be cancelled or how long was going to result the delay.

Ok. I can stand all this. What it is a completely shame is that they don't want to take responsibility of our several flights and hotels lost because of the delays, valued in 14.128 INR!

They offer me a voucher of 1.000 INR... valid 90 days. Common I don't even live in India! They are kidding me.

They are thieves! They opened my checkin luggage and stole my stuff from Ahmedabad-Dubai flight.

When I checked in, the airport staff had put a white SpiceJet strip on my bag. The on flight crew were Neelam, Dipika, Eteisile and Xavier. 

After landing in Dubai, I see that there is no strip on the bag. However, I think that it might have been removed by the Dubai airport authorities but I was wrong. When I reached the hotel in Dubai and opened my bag, I saw that my bag had been opened at the airport! All my clothes were a mess, my bag of toiletries was open and cash was stolen!

It is a clear sign of theft from the SpiceJet team. I have been trying to contact the customer executives, the nodal officer and the SpiceJet team but there is no response. I have traveled across the world but have never had such a bad experience in the past. All I request is for you to check the CCTV footage and you will clearly notice what I am saying.

It’s not luxury flying but it did its job of getting me safely from point A to point B (nearly on time). Spice Jet had the best times (for me) and the best price so overall it was a success! Yes the seats are older and you don’t get food/drink service included but I knew that in advance and wasn’t expecting it with the budget price.  I would definitely fly again with them and recommend it to friends. Thanks SpiceJet!,Asia,5.0,July 2019,17 July 2019,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
Flight 3022 constantly delayed,Mohana,Coimbatore - Chennai (Madras),"Booked Spicejet SG3022 (CJB to MAA) as departure time 8:40 pm was suitable. Received message a day before that flight delayed by 2hrs and another one the next day that it was delayed by another 2 hrs. Flight departed only at 12 am - almost 3.5 hr delay. When I check the flight history , I get to know that this flight has been delayed from Coimbatore by 3.5 hrs almost every day for last month. 
Airline has to change the schedule instead of misleading customers to pay more for 8:40 pm flights but delay take-offs. If you know you have an operational issue - why do you take us for a ride? I would rather book another airline that leaves at scheduled by paying extra instead of being misled and made to wait 4 hrs at the airport!",Domestic,3.0,July 2019,17 July 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Pretty good airline but need to focus more on leg space,Kamal kumar,Mumbai - Jaipur,Pretty happy with the way self-check In process but couldn’t really find a seat with the leg space. But when I asked at the counter for a seat with leg space  to my surprise I was told that I have to pay extra for that which I did not really like it and was also not informed at the time of booking. The boarding process was also hassle free but while I was seated in the aircraft it was really inconvenient and I felt really uncomfortable for 1 hour and 30 minutes but the best part of all this was the captain that we reached the destination 30 min before arrival time.

Travel safe not cheap,Stanzin,Leh - New Delhi,"Worst experience ever. I tried this airlines thrice and everytime i had the worst of the worst experience. They charge you even for a kilo that may exceed in your bag. As when it comes to looting money they are on the top but by the time it comes to deliver value for that money, baby they are long gone. Yesterday they lost baggage of around 30+ passengers traveling from Leh-Delhi and they made an excuse of fuel compromisation; hence can't ship the luggage. What they think we are, dumb of the dumbest. How other airlines fly, with all the passengers along with fuel, cargo and most importantly with customers luggage. Just because my bag wasn't shipped, i had to buy all new sets of clothing and accessories. But what about my documents that i can't buy. Don't fly cheap just fly safe for couple hundred rupees.

Poorly trained staff,Lauriana FF,Guwahati - Mumbai,"Spice Jet has very poorly trained flight attendants. My round trip from Mumbai to Guwahati in the first week of June was one of my worst flying experience till date.
The terminal was not mentioned correctly, we had to rush from the Domestic terminal to the International terminal in the early hours of morning. There were only 2 staff at the ticketing counters and the system as well as the staff were extremely slow. They kept asking passengers of other destinations to come forward when we were way past our check-in time without updating us about the status of our flight. The legrooom is way too constricted. The flight attendants don't check if seats are straight, window shades are open and trays closed during takeoff and landing. I had to ask the passenger in front of me to straighten her seat during landing. While returning, there was a passenger 2 rows behind me who was playing a video game on full volume. I requested the flight attendant to ask him to lower the volume, it was done halfheartedly and the passenger continued with the nuisance till we landed. The flight attendants just chose to turn a deaf ear to it all! Once again there were passengers reclining during landing.

Later after 10 am, it was announced that the flight is cancelled and if required the passengers can cancel the ticket of reissue it for the next day. By this time all the other flights have departed. The connecting flights were also not available. The airline was least bothered about about our time and value of our business loss. There were doctors also among the passengers who had to attend surgery at Calicut. It was so easy for them to say, ""if you want you can cancelled and get the refund or travel tomorrow"". What's the use of going another day when you have something to do today. I finally had to book another flight which costed me more than double to travel to Calicut. I expect SpiceJet to pay for my ticket fare and the other travel expenses and the business loss happened due to their flight cancellation.

Pathetic experience insulting our intelligence,Siddhartha S,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Mumbai,"Flight was delayed by 55 minutes, but we understand it was due to weather disruption of the incoming flight.
So at check-in, our bags were 3kgs over the limit. 2 pax travelling together, 2 bags weighing 33.2 kgs. The counter staff very clodly said you are overweight and this wont be allowed (her exact words, I mean, if I pay excess baggage, then suddenly it would be allowed, so why do talk about allowing or not allowing). I requested her to have a look at my co-traveler, age 76 years, and I showed her hand-baggage (containing ticket print-out n medicines only) and explained to her that she prefers to not carrying any weight on hand, and therefore the check in bag got a bit heavier. The counter lady said, so? what can I do? why can you not carry the extra 3 Kgs for her? (again her exact words - you look capable enough)
I wish I could tell her - do you know who I am? (unfortunately, I am an aam admi traveling cattle class for work)
When I nicely (I conduct trainings for softskills) again asked her to use her judgement and authorization, she said the system doesn't recognize my co-traveler as a senior citizen??? I asked her to look at my co-traveler again, and to check her Adhar as well, and to have a word with her seniors. Then she said something that shut my mouth up, and I stopped arguing. She said ""My seniors are all sitting in Delhi, how can I show them something when the system isn't recognizing her as a senior citizen.""
I quietly moved away from the counter, only informing her that I am shifting the weight, and getting the bag re-scanned, and that when I come back, I won't stand in the Q.
When I rerturned, I spoke to the gentleman in the next counter and while handing us our boarding cards, he said, you see, our staff is under a lot of pressure, but you should have requested for a supervisor. However, you have already done the needful, so there isn't a problem.

Hellooooooo!!!!
My father was an engineer with Air India, and my wife works with Emirates. I worked with Virgin Atlantic Airways for 5+ years, and know there's a scale difference leeway, so we were talking about only 1-2 kgs here.
I cannot believe it when I come across such illogical, pathetic service. Wish I get a chance to conduct a training with them. Spicejet is focusing only on grooming I suppose.

Overcharging and profiteering by Spice Jet,travellerIndian,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bagdogra,"Myself, my wife, my daughter and two grand daughters are the latest victim of over charging and profiteering by Spice Jet. I booked 5 tickets from Kolkatta to Pakyong (Sikkim) in the first week of April 2019. Just a day before they informed me that the flight to Pakyong would now terminate at Bagdogra due to alleged bad weather.   

There was no mention of how they will assist us to get to Sikkim from Bagdogra. When I checked the fare from Kolkatta to Bagdogra, I discovered that the difference was about Rs. 3500.00 per passenger. So, I ended up paying Rs. 17500 extra for my 5 tickets.

When I took up the matter with their customer service, which got escalated to the nodal officer which was later escalated to the Appellate Authority, all of them refused to refund the fare difference.

Please note that they charged a higher fare and under performed by flying to a lesser fare structure. I am publicizing this to show how these so called low cost airlines are exploiting this kind of situation. Had I booked my ticket to Bagdogra in the first instance, i would have paid a lower fare. Neither did they provide any kind of help to get me to my destination with the ground staff both at Kolkatta and Bagdogra just smilingly saying that they could not help. The only succour they offered after prolonged correspondence was a flying voucher of Rs. 500 per person. It was an insulting offer which I immediately turned down.
So, be wary when you book with them. They will profiteer at your expense and then say proudly that they have made profit in their annual financial report.",Domestic,1.0,April 2019,18 June 2019,3.0,3.0,N/A,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

In fact, Airlines should be prevented from such a practice. They show that the fares are low when you book a ticket. But when you want to check in in advance, they charge you. This is no good a practice. This is an irritant. I feel like never ever travelling with such airlines.
There was a hassle at the security gate. The security personnel was not ready to accept our makemytrip document. We were not able to use internet to download the tickets.

Spicejet’s baggage policy sucks,Rey,Dehradun - New Delhi,"All I felt about Spicejet is that they are ready to rip you off with their bogus rules specifically baggage. I have used spice jet a few times Dehradun-Delhi flight 
They have a weird baggage policy. They will cite safety issues. If you don’t pay for baggage in advance then it may cost the same amount as you have paid for your seat. 
They allow max 15- 20 kg it doesn’t matter how many bags do you have. Basically you can split 20 kg in 20 bags. Safety issue? 

I had packed my cabin bag according to the dimensions mentioned on the website but the manager at the airport tried to fit my bag in the small metal bin. He showed me it doesn’t fit. He never tried put the bag inside properly. Well, I packed according to the dimension on the website and not according to the metal bin. Even if it is 1 or 2 cm above it shouldn’t matter. It won’t bring the flight down.
Later I saw a person traveling with a disfigured bag which I am sure could not have fit in that mold. Bad customer service.

We ended up paying the same amount we paid for the ticket. It was far from low cost ticket.

 Hot tea was cold. Didn’t try their food though.

The only good part was, flight was on time 

In this amount we could have hired a taxi to New Delhi.

After bag security at Goa airport yesterday I went to check in, and there was complete disorder and lack of passenger control, with only one check in desk open and the girl unable to cope with the increasing queue. After 40 minutes of waiting I went to find the manager who was not interested and sent me back to the unruly 'queue' where people were fighting over not wanting to pay for excess luggage or the fact that they were next in line. When I finally managed to get my boarding pass security screening was a nightmare too, not necessarily because of Spicejet but the volume of people travelling with young children which didn't bode well for the impending flight. Boarding was late, with no explanation for the delay, and the aircraft was shabby and old with seats that wouldn't come into upright position and stitching coming apart at the seams. The plane had an overall grubby feel to it, masked my COUNTLESS advertising slogans and banners plastered EVERYWHERE on the walls and seat backs, including an advert for nicotine patches which I thought was weird for an airline to be promoting. No-one came by to check that electrical devices were off for take off, or tray tables stowed, passengers were still walking around as we taxied out, with no passenger control. The drinks trolley didn't have the full selection as listed in the glossy brochure. No inflight information was given by the pilots or any explanation given for the delay. Children were not strapped in for landing. No seatbelt reminders were given as we flew through turbulence.

All the clothes were wet except for Lehgna which was packed. I was going for holidays to celebrate my daughter's birthday. I had no clothes to wear and had to immediately purchase. New clothes with tag on were spoilt which was showed at the counter on New Delhi airport. Yamini assisted with bags - garbage bags to keep clothes and no manager was available.Took pictures and asked me to write a complaint and would get back in 48 hours. No revert for 9 days.  On way back on 29th May when I contacted Mumbai Airport they had no clue and told me to call customer care and gave me complaint number and said the complaint was not written. I have travelled many times domestic and international but never ever water has been put on baggage. It was good 3 - 4 litres of water and wondered what water it was. Mistakes do happen but the way the assurance was given and no one came back I think spice jet is good at getting the traveller out of the airport and then sits back. I did not take the flight back of spice jet because I was so disappointed.,Domestic,3.0,May 2019,30 May 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
Everlate airlines!! Can be renamed SpiceBullockcart!!,Rama,Mumbai - Chennai (Madras),It had been already several times that I travelled this airlines and number of times its been delayed. Especially the delay of the flight leaving in the night beyond two hours becomes a great irritation and nuisance. Further the communication of delay reaches the mobile after arrival to airport.

Money makers,Escape1990,Hyderabad - Mumbai,So my flight was at 0740 am and I did check in and passed through long security check queue and reached boarding gate at 07:17am and I was told boarding gate is closed. Staff is not even bothered I get only one answer gate is closed and book new flight. Good way to earn money when u know u r the only option as airline like jet airways is closed. Than helpless I approach Indigo staff he helped me to get my bag back helped me to reservation counter and spicejet staff no where to be seen.. at reservation counter two staff members chitchatting and asking me to wait for 5 mins as they have to finish handover. I mean cant u see stressed passenger. There are other two passengers who were also struggling with similar issue there was no one to help. When I call customer service they said to give a phone to staff there but no one is ready to talk on phone as they started boarding of other flight and they dont have staff to help me... when I booked tickets that time only I was not sure about travelling with spice jet and this incident gave me confidence that not to travel with spice jet... only bunch of idiots there to rip u off with money.. also when I booked my other flight tickets they wants to charge me 750 rs as a no show charge...

When the customers told him that complain would be made against him he said he was not bothered about the same.

Pathetic service by inflight crew,tanveer s,Mumbai - Hyderabad,"While visiting Spicejet page got to know they completed 14yrs... though they proudly claim they completed 14yrs but their inflight experience sucks...their staff attitude is as high as the altitude of their airplane is flying! 

I don't know what they think of themselves? We passengers are paying their salaries and they must believe in service rather then care a damn about it.

let me share my recent experience with Spicejet flight, I was flying from Mumbai to Hyderabad on 19th May and my experience is elaborated as under to Spicejet customer care team:

I am writing this mail with great grief and 
disappointment on behaviour of your crew member Vaibhav and Julie.

While ordering my meal I had taken Cocojal bottle and requested your crew to replace with other Britania Milk shake, Julie Crew gave very cold response and asked me it's already opened which I replied its sealed and she disappeared, once again I have given a call and vaibhav came to attend me to my surprise he too gave same response without even checking the bottle.
 

I was pissed off and returned the drink and Vaibhav just took it back after checking the seal, how sad is that!

Don't understand this logic of your crew members ? Why would any guest return his drink if he has already opened the bottle, we too have that sense and will never expect it to be replaced.

After paying for my meal I am returning without having my drink, is this the service you offer to your privilege guest....extremely pathetic.

I have requested to talk to supervisor Faizal but till I landed nobody bothered to attend my complaint.

Must tell you, your crew members have lot of attitude and this wont help in long term.

So just converting Jet Airways plane into Speicejet wont bring service attitude in your staffs let me tell this to Spice Jet customer service custodians...they have to believe in service and also do it with pride... at the end what matters is how many happy travelers fly with your airline not those swanky girl staff with sky high attitude !

By the way I did complaint on Customer service and they simply wrote a generic mail and trying close this matter, no courtesy to customer's loss of money and time! I have paid upfront for food and the seat which costed me Rs.1798/-
Why would I let go when I paid for my drink which was not served and taken back without any apology by the inflight staff!

Thanks and hope you look into this feedback and take necessary action and refund my money which I paid for the product.",Domestic,1.0,May 2019,26 May 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

WRONG DECISION,Prabu07,Colombo - Chennai (Madras),"I wanted to go to chennai with my wife and 7 month old son, when i checked online for prices, I found the ""Spice Max"" price to chennai was similar to Srilankan airline Economy Prices but Spice max included with Extra Legroom, Entertainment, Alcholic Bev, Priority Service, Etc. I was happy and tried to book the flight, while trying i was pausing at the last stage for some reasons, I immediately received a call from Spicejet asking if am in need of any help to complete the payment, even the lady said she is extending the booking for payment. in few minutes time I received another call asking if I need help to complete the payment, I requested a bit more time and was trying to complete the payment but the system did not accept my payment at the end of the process but in less than a minute time, I received a confirmation from my bank that my card has been charged. what was surprising to me was, when I tried to make payment, I received 2 calls to help me to complete the payment but when I needed help to get clarification on the payment that spice jet system did not accept, even after 30 minutes on hold my phone was never answered. I had no choice than making another payment on the same booking after numerous calls failed in the process of getting help. having that to be sorted out, we went to the airport expecting to get help from the chennai airport on the duplicate payment.

When we were checking in, we were Told that we could take the baby stroller up to the flight and again can be taken when we leave the flight, we were happy and took the stroller up to the flight and gave it to the officer before getting in to the flight. When we got on the flight, there was no greeting or welcoming at all :(, We sat on the seat allocated and was looking for flight entertainment, there was non :(, extra legroom?? was not so good, Alcoholic Beverages were never offered. The cabin crew was not friendly or attentive at all on the flight to Chennai. we got the meal but the trays were not cleared until the flight was landed. when we were leaving the flight, I requested for the stroller, I was told by a crew lady with a very frowning face that it will come on the Belt. I have been a frequent traveller but never had seen a poor service like we had on this flight.

On the way back to colombo, I inquired about the duplicate payment at checkin, I was told that I have to get in touch with the airline on emails. I did sent and an email and the refund received after few days was nearly LKR5,000 less. after numerous emails, I was not successful in getting my over charged amount back.

The flight back to colombo was not so Bad as the flight to chennai. Staff were very attentive and helpful. we were properly greeted upon arrival and departure.",Asia,3.0,May 2019,24 May 2019,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

"Pretentious Marketing, do not be fooled. (first time flyer of this airline)",Erick D,Hong Kong - New Delhi,"1. Perpetually delayed flights one way or another. 
2. Marketing seems like a deception to me. Shows that they have good service and experience. Nope. 
3. Old aircrafts. 
4. Challenging booking service website, higher possibility of making an error.

It might seem to be a well-marketed airline but do not be deceived. Glad I didn’t get the SpiceMax option. No special feel with those at all if the rest of the flight is less than mediocre. First of all, I was already having issues while booking using their website. It has insufficiencies and also major errors that got me redoing my booking a couple of times. I booked for two people with the seat & food package but only one went through and got it and then the other person got selected with only the seat priority, that means I have to repurchase the food in a different transaction, not until after learning it because I review my flight after I purchase it; reviewing it before you purchase also isn’t a very efficient interface as well!!!! (so mad) So yeah, fine, ticket done purchased. Come flight HKG-DEL. Already 5hrs delayed since 2 days before the flight. Thanks for the notice. But the only reason being, because of ”Operational Issues”. What the hell is that? Is it legally valid to have incompetence as a reason to delay flight? Haha so LOW. Soooo, we got to our flight. Old aircraft, below average service, not so nice air con system, all in all, the same feeling of having that delay, same level of feeling inside the cabin. Low. Yeah, this is what I get from choosing a cheaper airline. Now, moving on to the flight going back to HKG from DEL. My friends and I are so glad there weren’t any updates regarding delays so our flight is well flying on time. Our flight should be arriving few hours before our work call-time (I know, never again!) so we are thankful about no announcement of delay. But NO, SpiceEFFINGjet decided to delay the flight while everyone’s there waiting in front of our gate at the airport. Reason: IDK. The aircraft is just there in front of us, apparently, there was no clearance to board it, not even the crew who went there on time, like everyone else. Guess what? Delayed again for 2hrs and 30mins. Almost missed worked by a margin of ZERO minutes. Plus the fact that flying experience is as below average as always, plus the cabin is hotter than the flight going to DEL, and this is a midnight flight!

"Lied to, ignored, aggressive advertising strategies, terrible experience!",Griffin,Bengaluru - Dharamsala,"This was one of the worst experiences I've had with any airline. This company:

-Lied about the price of the flight

-Ignored my emails, I sent 5 emails to the customer service people and was ignored in all of them

-and used extremely intense brainwashing and advertising techniques to try to manipulate people into spending money

I'll elaborate on all three. Overall, however, this company is terrible, unethical, and possibly downright evil.

On their webpage booking site, it shows the price of the flight, in my case 11,433 rs, and it says in the bottom left corner ""Prices include taxes and fees"". When you attempt to purchase the flight, however, it adds another 1000 rs in ""convenience charge"" for 500 and ""convenience  fee"" for 500. This is complete blatant lying and theft. It doesn't even make sense to me how you could pretend this is anything other than a total lie.

Then, when I emailed them about this to ask for the 1000 rs to be refunded, I got a single, extremely terse email asking for my flight booking number. The best part is that the email ended with ""assuring you of our best attention at all times"" HAHAHA, what a joke. I quickly provided the booking number and didn't hear back from them for 3 days. Then I sent my first email asking to confirm that they got my previous email and re-stating my request for the 1000 rs that was dishonestly charged to be refunded.

I never got any response to this. Three days later, I sent them yet another email, this time quite annoyed, that I still hadn't heard back from them and was obviously being ignored.

Then I sent them ANOTHER email asking for a response and still have not heard back from them. They completely ignored me and refuse to assist me in any way. ""Our best attention"", yeah right.

And worst of all was how terribly manipulative their behavior was on the flight. They had every single seat back covered in an advertisement for some flight add-on and it used very obvious psychological manipulation tactics. It was bright red letter saying ""Choose [add-on]"". The idea behind this advertisement is to unconsciously influence people into purchasing the add-on because the statement ""choose [x]"" is an attempt to subliminally influence people. By plastering this advertisement all over the entire plane, they're trying to make it so you can't even open your eyes without them trying to subconsciously manipulate you.

If that wasn't bad enough, they also blast similar advertisements over the speakers. I tried to deal with the ads on the seats by keeping my eyes closed as much as I could, and reminding myself that this was a manipulation attempt whenever I did open my eyes and see the advertisement, but every fifteen minutes for the entire 2 1/2 hour flight they would come on the speakers and make some announcement about their brand, ending it with ""thank you for choosing [brand]"". As above, this is a blatant manipulation attempt to try to psychologically program people into purchasing things from them. So, I tried to deal with that, but then they also run the food carts up and down the aisle over, and over, and over. They're constantly attempting to get people to spend money and subconsciously influence them into making purchases that they, for the entire 2 1/2 hour flight would every ten minutes bring the food cart down the aisle asking over and over again ""Would you like to buy something? would you like to buy something? would you like to buy something?"".

This made it impossible to get any rest during the flight, not to mention was equally upsetting, because it was yet another attempt from this company to try to squeeze more money out of you.

So basically, these people are so greedy and rude that they 1) lie to you about the price, 2) ignore you if you ask for justice, 3) try to subconsciously manipulate you into spending more money on their company in the future by attempting to psychologically program people with advertisements, and 4) constantly barrage you with attempts to ask you to spend more on the food cart.

I hate this company, and this was one of the worst travel experiences I have ever had. I highly suggest no body ever use this company, especially if you do not like people trying to manipulate you.",Domestic,1.0,May 2019,18 May 2019,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

horrible nightmare,Manish-blr,Dubai - New Delhi,"i wish there was a 0 star option for the nightmare we went through with spicejet in dubai airport. first of all they always fly few hours late, it is default to fly 1-2 hours late for them - never seen this kind of lazy pathetic attitude with any other airline. so we were not suprised to get a message 5 hours before departure that their flight is late by 2 hours. in any case we were on abu dhabi tour and delayed our return by 1 hour - we reached airport at 8pm and checkin was done by 9pm - then the horror story revealed - in 5 installments they delayed they flight by 16 HOURS, never giving any accurate info till the very end , useless staff at airport who were hiding behind the airport and emirates staff to shield themselves. everytime the departure time apporached, they pushed by 1-2 hours so that they could inflict maximum TORTURE and avoid giving compesation to stranded passengers. We had senior citizens and small kids in our group and we had to sit at the departure gate for 8 hours. then we asked for their senior staff as they said flight is delayed from 5.30 am to 12.25 pm. there he is saying - we have arranged lounge for you, but no one informed us. again lounge has only chairs - no place to sleep. again flight is delayed by 1 hour and finally left at 2 pm  instead of 10.45pm departure of last night.

Never choose SpiceJet if you are a person with time commitments.i booked 9.50am flight as i wanted to reach Madurai before 1pm.

I spoke to one Mr.Ashwin one of the SpiceJet officer incharge and he confirmed that affected passengers will be compensated with ""Samosa ,Cake and a drink""🤔.

SHAME ON YOU!

On our way back from Dubai on 7/8 may (past midnight landing into Pune) we even SWATTED A COCROACH COMING DOWN THE ROOF OVER THE WINDOW PANE with our shoe, just before landing into Pune.

The condition of the seats. Broken tables that are SCOTCH TAPED. 

Horrible carpets stained and unclean.

Seats and covers have holes and look like there could be bug and maybe even some other pest infestation inside them.

SERVICE WAS FANTASTIC, but the condition of the aircraft is only to cry about.

Shame that Spicejet and the DGCA have turned a blind eye to this menace or this aircraft , maybe it could be called a converted ST BUS THAT CAN FLY.

Since the next flight was in the evening I dropped the plan of rescheduling the flight. With no options left I booked Indigo flight which was scheduled to leave at 11:15.

The main differences which I observed is that I had got no messages from spicejet about check in time and online check in link, but got the same from Indigo team.

On the top of that, the reading light focused onto my seat was not working and I was not transferred to any other seat by the crew citing the reason that the aircraft was full. This all provided me with nothing but trouble in reading the book I wanted to.

I would conclude that service provided to me was pathetic in terms of seating (non-reclining seat even upon requesting), spending my 2 hours onboard(light not working), and lastly in handling my luggage (breaking of my laptop).",Domestic,1.0,April 2019,25 April 2019,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0

When I inquired about new dates for my flight due to the situation, she simply said, it’s not our fault and wanted to charge me a change fee or a cancellation fee.

SpiceMax NOT Worth for your money!,nukhing,New Delhi - Bangkok,"From the ads, SpiceMax offers an extra legroom, a complimentary meal and beverage including blanket and cushion, priority check-in, priority boarding and priority baggage handling, so I decided to buy the service for my group in order to get a worth experience. However, what I got from SpiceMax was extremely unsatisfied service as follows:
1. Priority Check-in: we had been waiting at the counter for SpiceMax, but the staff wasn’t ready while counters for regular SpiceJet passengers were ready and served people in line before the SpiceMax counter.
2. Priority Boarding: we were waiting at the gate (14A), and no one announced for SpiceMax boarding. There were many people in line, so I asked the ground staff, and also showed all 6 boarding passes with SpiceMax, and asked him about “the Priority Boarding”. He said “NO” and told me to wait in line. So what is Priority Boarding?
3. Priority Baggage Handling: When we arrived at BKK Airport, our baggage was NOT being handled on priority though we had priority tag on all of our luggage. Many SpiceJet passengers had their luggage before I had mine. Do I pay extra for a non-priority service?
4. Meal and beverage: thank you very much as we had this service on board. However, for blanket and cushion, when I asked the staff, they said they already placed on our seats. They were kind enough to look for it from another passengers, and finally they got two more for us, but we didn’t want to use them as they are used by someone else.",Southeast Asia,2.0,April 2019,23 April 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

One thing I didn't like was that while boarding (via bus), we were taken in the bus to a remote stand where the aircraft was parked but we had to stand in the bus for a good 10 minutes (I assume the cabin wasn't ready).

We ultimately ended up paying for the luggage because there was no other choice.

Not worth upgrading,DonnamjCan,Chennai (Madras) - Port Blair,"We paid the upgrade fee for priority boarding, meals, leg room, priority baggage (premium service upgrade). All we got was more legroom.

We did not receive our bags before anyone else (or in reasonable time—one bag was dead last! Despite the priority tag on it). 
Also there is no entertainment on this flight unless you download it before the flight. I wouldn’t fly it again. At the end of the flight we were also supposed to have priority deplaning however the flight attendants had no interest in maintaining that and the passengers all moved up to empty seats prior to landing so the front of the plane was packed for the last ten min of the flight. It was bizarre that was allowed. When the planes stopped the passengers literally stampeded to the front of the plane in the absence of any announcement to do otherwise. So don’t waste your money.

Upgraded flight from Amritsar to Dubai,Bubs K,Amritsar - Dubai,"I upgraded my Fathers return flight from ATQ - DXB with SpiceJet before his flight from DXB. This provided my father (who is almost 80yrs of age) with Priority Check-In at ATQ, select an Extra Leg Room Seat and have Priority Bag Retrieval upon his arrival in DXB.
At check-in my father was told to show the card which was made for the upgrade. My father explained that the card is with his son in Dubai. After long delays and bickering, he was forced to pay for the upgrade again. What should have been a smooth hassle free experience actually caused my father mores stress and anxiety with the priority check-in.
The selected seat (1A) on the aircraft was meant to have extra leg room but in fact was hindered by the aircraft door so my father couldn't stretch his legs. This was stated as a seat with extra leg room which was clearly incorrect.
Upon his arrival into DXB his checked-in bag should have been the first bags on the belt but he was left waiting for his luggage like others who had not paid for the upgraded service.
He was told by the check-in staff in ATQ that the money for the upgrade which was paid by credit card will be refunded back to the card. I tried to contact SpiceJet here to claim a refund and was informed I have to email any complaints. I did so and am still awaiting a response and my refund.

Pathetic Treatment by Checkin staff- Spicejet never again!!,Dsareen,New Delhi - Pune,"I travel every week between Delhi Pune(return), and often take spicejet amongst other airlines. But one incidence, on 18th Mar 2019, has mired the entire experience, making me never to take SpiceJet again. 
The checkin staff singled me out and asked me to pay extra as my checking baggage was over by 2Kgs (15->17Kgs). I agreed to pay 800 rs for extra 2Kgs, but then i was asked to weigh by cabin bag as well, which was 8.7(7->8.7) and I was asked to pay 800 more. Total 1600. I was appalled as in my previous weekly trips to Pune I have never been charged for cabin baggage. I asked the checkin fellow to weigh everyone’s bag who are behind me in the check-in queue and 90% of them will have over 7Kgs(one can easily make out even looking at them that those bags were over 7kgs). But he insisted upon me coughing up 1600, and once I did he didn’t bother to check weight of anyone’s checkin bag, who were behind me in the queue. 
I am upset by the fact that I was signalled out. 
If you( Spicejet) is so keen to follow rules to the letter then it should be for all. Since then I have decided never to travel with spicejet. Even if their tickets, for my weekly trips, are cheaper than the other airlines, I still don’t book Spicejet.
Unfortunately, because of one checkin staff the airline has lost a valuable customer ( and many more as word-of-mouth spread) and even after posting the incident to the airline, there was not even an acknowledgement from their end.

So to get preferred seats (as we are 7 members) I did web checkin at the time of doing I shocked by clearly understanding their looting strategy. These cheap airline has very low level cheap strategies like they free seats avialble only in middle of each row that means if your 2,3,4 or more family member then you will get single seat in the middle of every row. And If you want desired seats then you have to pay extra charges which 200 for each seat WTF!! However it was urgent i paid 200 and allocate desired seats.

Now in evey call they haven’t mentioned single word about luggage or check in baggage. When I reach to airport and goes for check in then lady shamelessly said that you can not carry your luggage, I said is it more than 15 kg?

She said i don’t know its our process you have to pay, you booked tickets from third party so we won’t allowed you to take luggage you have to pay for this. I denied to pay she said we won’t allow you to take luggage.

 This is completely unprofessional behaviour she charged me 400 Rs for each bag and given normal hand written receipt which can fraud or looting agenda.

Never again,mathu,Chennai (Madras) - Mumbai,"I just got off a call with my parents who are travelling in India.  I can’t believe what I just heard from them! Are we in the 21century?! My parents are currently in India and boarded a flight from Chennai to go to Mumbai. After the flight had ascended, my elderly father asked an air hostess to point him in the direction of the washroom.  She told him that he couldn't use the washroom on board because people are eating. He tried to talk to a couple of them and told them he was diabetic but they told him to sit down. He had to hold it until they landed. This situation really humiliated my father who has never experienced this in his life.  

I have never been disgusted in my life toward anyone or a company. In all my travels, I have never experienced this nor have I heard it from anyone else. No one  should be denied of this basic human function, especially when you paid money for you flight seat which includes the right to use the washroom. Spice jet probably is tying to make the washroom pay per use ? They could have told him how much and he would have paid. 

My parents have been in India a few times before and have always flown on Indigo; they never experienced this there.

I had a plane ticket from Pakyong (funny that your format not registered this as a functional airport) with Spicejet, not knowing that this route is hardly used (with the excuse of inestable weather) so I ended traveling in a rush for 4 hours to fill, conveniently for Spicejet, a plane to Delhi via Kolkata for the double the price, instead of the direct flight to Delhi at 3:45.

Pleasant flight,Sharad Shrimali,Jodhpur - Ahmedabad,"One of my close family members recently travelled on SG 2977 from Jodhpur to Ahmedabad.

Check-in procedures were good, boarding was efficient. The aircraft was a DH8 or Q400 Bombardier Dash, a turboprop which was well-maintained and clean. 

The crew were helpful and friendly. Complimentary glasses of water were served to all passengers before takeoff, a gesture I truly like from Spicejet, which markets itself as a Low Cost Carrier (LCC). May some other LCCs follow suit and it would be appreciated.

The takeoff and landing were smooth. Arrival was ahead of schedule by nearly 25 mins.

The web check-in policy leaves much to be desired - a point mentioned in an earlier review of flight SG 2976 to Jodhpur which was taken a day before this flight.

"Nice flight, but awful web check in policy",Sharad Shrimali,Ahmedabad - Jodhpur,"It was a good experience travelling via Spicejet to the Blue City from Ahmedabad. Actually it was my family member who travelled.

Check-in at the counter was quick, boarding was flawless. 
The crew was all smiles and helpful. 
Aircraft was a DH8 which was comfortable and clean.
Flight departed on time, landed before time. 
Being an LCC (Low Cost Carrier), I obviously didn't expect complimentary meals and didn't buy any either, hence can't comment on that.

However, the web check in policy is horrible. No free seat selection while doing web check in even 4 hours before the departure of the flight. Even some other LCC competitors like Indigo and some others like Jet Airways allow free web check in at least 12 and 4 hours before departure, respectively.

Personally I didn't like that at all and was bitterly disappointed. Web check in is meant for the convenience of passengers so that time at the airport can be saved. Change such policy, please, Spicejet, otherwise I'll reconsider twice or even thrice before flying the Red, Hot, Spicy.

Nevertheless, thanks to the service levels and crew and staff, sans the web check in, I truly recommend Spicejet.",Domestic,5.0,March 2019,27 March 2019,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

I grudgingly paid Rs.200 for the aisle seat and Rs.99 for the middle seat, that was the only way I could do the web check-in. Then comes the next surprise from the airline, they sent a message stating that the flight has been advanced to 6.45AM from its original schedule of 7AM, which is what we had booked for. That played havoc on our preparations.
The worst was that the two seats given to us were non reclining seats and the check-in staff told me that they are reclining seats. Worst, there's just no legroom in this exit row 2 seats on each side. We had to sit tight for those 3 hours. The other two passengers were relocated to comfortable seats, after the take off.  But we  two were left alone to struggle with these seats as we were modest in raising our objections. That clearly didn't work.

Find another airline,Rasputin21,Union Territory of Pondicherry - Bengaluru,"We flew from Pondicherry to Bangalore on Spicejet.  Since Spicejet is the only airline flying into and out of Pondicherry, they have a captive market.  
Arriving early we found a rather spartan airport that one accesses across a rutted wasteland.  There are no services at the airport.  As we had driven from Tranquebar, leaving there before 6.30am without breakfast, we hoped to be able to get something to eat at the airport.  On arrival, we were directed to baggage security who scanned our baggage and taped and locked tied each article.  We very nearly ended up on the Hyderabad flight as the staff kept pushing us to the check in.  We then waited several hours without any food for our flight which was slightly late.  The check in staff who had also been trying to put us on the Hyderabad flight were then upset that our luggage had been scanned and locked well prior to our flight.  I was about to explode at their incompetence when they decided that since we had not been out of the airport with our luggage (where in heavens name could we have gone?) they would accept the check in luggage.
When calling for boarding, they started at row 8 and failed to call us at row 2.  Only when we found that we were the last in the lounge that we decided to head off for the plane.  We had booked and paid for front row seats with extra leg room but found ourselves in ordinary seats with no leg room for my over 6ft husband.  We had also pre paid for a meal which indicated that we could choose from a variety of dishes.  We were given soggy veg sandwiches and a diet coke without any choice!  The sandwich made me sick.  We left the other.
The uniforms of the female crew left nothing to the imagination when they crouched down or bent over.  SpiceJet needs to review its uniforms in line with the uniforms of other airlines.

Arrival at Jaipur Airport for flight by SpiceJet to Goa I was refused boarding passes.,Andy Hamlett,Jaipur - Goa,"After bag check, at check-in desk I was asked to produce the “CARD” I had paid for the flight with.

I produced my MasterCard and was told it had the wrong number. i.e. not the number of the card that paid the bill to SpiceJet. I was refused a boarding pass until I produced the card which made the payment for their services.
i.e. Transfer to Goa via SpiceJet flight SG923. SpiceJet had details of a payment card number on their system which did not agree with the number on my credit card.

I was escorted to the Airport SpiceJet office to be shown the small print on “Important Information” para 8.
i.e. for foreign (non-Indian) credit/debit card payments, the card must be produced for physical verification at airport check-in counter etc etc……. 

They would not accept any paperwork I had as verification of payment. All they wanted to see was a credit card giving the same number from which the payment for the flight was made.

Eventually, I was given the opportunity to write a statement explaining this predicament. This statement needed details of my home address, home telephone number, email address, current credit card details, travel agency details,flight booking details, plus a photocopy of any payment confirmation. 

After even more considerable time and consideration by even more officials at the airport, they finally agreed to produce our boarding passes. This process took nearly 2 hours to complete and had I arrived at the airport any time later I would have certainly missed the flight.

Who do I consider at fault?.....

SpiceJet for expecting unreasonable requirement in their small print as there are a number of scenarios which could easily produce this situation. Card replacement, cash payment, lost card  etc, etc

The only alternative offered by SpiceJet was to buy further tickets and claim the extra cost back from my travel agent. 

All this at the airport with very limited time for me to decide was also exacerbated by the English/Hinde language barrier and the urgency of creeping time constraints, plus I find it difficult to believe, unless I am the first customer you have booked on a flight with SpiceJet that situation has not occurred before.

Food was spilled on me despite me not even having food. The cabin crew had no control what so ever and I did tell them I did not feel safe.
There were no prelanding checks made and parents passing their children to their grand parents who were not belted in either at point of landing!

Worst airline I have ever come across!,Lee Yip,Goa - New Delhi,"We had a very bad experience to the point where one of the customers slapped a staff at the airport. I have written a complaint so it is easier to summarise the whole experience:

Subject: RE: Complaint: Flight SG-8172 on 15 February 2019 from Goa to Delhi

Dear Sir/Madam,

This is the first time I have flown with your airline as a tourist and to be honest this is the worst I have ever come across. Here is a summary of events:

Checked in online and paid to choose and reserve seats
Arrived at the airport and the computer system was down causing chaos at the check in counters
Me and my friends were first in the Goa to Delhi counter (after trying to find which was the correct counter)
We paid extra for S.Max seats, priority boarding and luggage, meals etc
The tickets were handwritten (see attached) due to the system being down as mentioned
We paid for priority boarding but the staff at the gates allowed non-priority to go in first and my friend was annoyed and ask that we go first
When we arrived at our seats, there were other passengers claiming these were theirs and it turned out there were quadruple bookings for the same seats
A big argument arose and a staff arrived asking us to change seats; my friend refused stating we were first in the check in counter and this was an issue with the airline and not us, so we remained at our seats
Other passengers had the same issue and it must have taken a good 30 minutes to have this dealt with
When we arrived in Delhi, 3 of our 4 luggage had the priority label but the fourth did not so we had to wait for about 15 minutes, I believe the priority label was attached with two staples which was pathetic when you should have used proper plastic tie-through labels.
My advice to your staff when this issue happens again is to:
Have a manager/supervisor who has an aura of confidence between staff and passengers
Print an A3 of the destinations and stuck these to the monitors so passengers can queue accordingly rather than pushing and shoving each other to get across to the correct counter (see attached) 
Use the public announcement (PA) system to help passengers accordingly and do de-escalate all incidents
If your staff gave me the opportunity on that day to help, I am sure I would have been able to resolve this fiasco for free; this incident left a bad reminder to staff and passenger and the carrier next door, Vistara was quite amused looking at the chaos in hand.

I hope you will learn from this and make recommendations for your Goa staff to be retrained with higher levels of customer service and to deal with customer conflicts and resolutions; otherwise your company will go bust in the near future.

Chaotic Chennai Airport and a badly timed flight. SG 731 to Hyderabad.,YatriForever,Chennai (Madras) - Hyderabad,"At the time of booking, the scheduled time of departure from Chennai was 5.05AM. Later, the airline sent repeated messages that the departure has been advanced to 4.50AM !! That isn't being very kind !
I had done we check-in, printed the boarding pass and had no bags to check-in. I did all I can to make my boarding easy ! But I could only get seat #31, and that a middle seat which I always avoid ! There's hardly any seat which is given free when you do the web check. So, the airline does everything they can to push you to pay for the seats, even for middle seat. This is not the first time i experienced this challenge. So bad the airline is. But then what choice do we have? 
The Chennai airport, which is anyway mismanaged; is now slipping from bad to worse. The directions/ signage for Gate 16 was misleading.  Despite Chennai being my home airport,  despite my  deep familiarity  of this chaotic airport with over 500 departures by me in the past 7-8 years, I was still put to confusion on the departure gate's location !! What a mess ! The airline didn't have any staff to guide the PAX after the security check point. 
The most shocking experience was the 19 minutes bus ride from the terminal to the aircraft which was parked at the hanger, very far away from the terminal. The bus first headed north , all the way to the St.Thomas Mount end/ beginning point of the runway on the road parellel to the runway, then turn around to the other side of the runway to reach this remote hanger. I have never experienced such a long bus ride within the airport!  So, by the time the flight pulled out of the bay, it was 5.10+am ! Perhaps, the advancing of the scheduled departure is to bridge the time required for the  bus transportation! Sounds wierd. 
The flight was turbulent, the food/beverage sale services were delayed. 
The only good thing was the service of the in-flight crew;  very efficient, friendly and pleasent they were. 
This flight goes further to Patna, seems popular with folks from Chennai who are traveling to Bihar. 
This is certainly not a flight you wanna take if you have serious business work in Hyderabad. You won't be productive, with sleep deprived previous night. It wasn't even dawn in Hyderabad when we landed , but we waited for so long in the bus to take us to the terminal, it was beginning of the dawn, as seen in the photos attached.

Height of Unprofessionalism in Spicejet,Shubhangi,New Delhi - Ahmedabad,"This review pertains to my experience on board SG 8913 from Delhi to Ahmedabad on 16.02.2019. 

I was unfortunate enough to be on-board todays flight and the lack of professionalism and courteousness shown by the Spicejet staff, who are supposed to be the creamy layer of the Hospitality industry was astounding. I experienced the following on-board the above mentioned flight today morning: 

1. While it may or may not be a necessary condition in this particular airline, certain characteristic behaviour has come to be expected from airlines by frequent travellers such as I. The behaviour i am referring to is, usually, as witnessed in all other airlines (even other low cost airlines, such as Go Air and indigo), during boarding, the airlines ensure that the cabin crew welcomes their passengers with a smile on their faces and maybe direct them to their seats. 

Though, while boarding the flight today, the first sight on stepping into the aircraft was 2 female cabin crews putting make up on and ignoring us (the passengers) 

While I support and fully stand by women’s right to look good and also understand its importance while working in the aviation industry, i am unsure if Spicejet Gives precedence to how its staff LOOKS over How they BEHAVE.

2. In this point I’d like to specifically mention one cabin crew, Ms. Deepansha. A trivial situation had occurred with the over head baggage compartment, wherein someone sitting next to me had stuffed his bag in such a fashion that the compartment couldnt be closed. Ms. Deepansha tried to stuff the baggage in, and on being unable to do so, shifted it to another compartment. Once she had shifted the bag, another passenger sitting two rows ahead of mine, asked her if she could also adjust his bag in one of the compartments. 

Now, forgive me for making assumptions, but i am of the opinion, that had this happened in any other airline, the cabin staff would have helped the passenger out. Instead, Ms. Deepansha, glared at him and said ‘bhot jagah hai, aap khud rakhlo,’ i.e. there is plenty of space, put your bag yourself. 

As insignificant as it might seem to the airline, this behaviour doesnt really say ‘the best and brightest in the hospitality industry.’ More like, ‘the worst and rudest.’ Maybe NOT the image Spicejet wants to portray. 

3. Further, While trying to close the baggage compartment over my seat, Ms Deepansha sought the help of one of her colleagues, Mr. Lohit. Who very gracefully came over to help her through the pickle. Though, my issue began when, since i was on the aisle seat, in his attempt to close the compartment, he pushed so hard that the ‘not very public parts’ of his body were brushing my shoulder. 

I was taken aback to say the least. Not only wasnt there any ‘excuse me,’ so i could maybe move first, there wasnt any apology rendered to me either when i made a face. I wonder if caressing women’s shoulders with men’s privates, is an everyday part of the spicejet cabin crew job description. That is definitely some company policy. Though does spicejet really want to stand apart from the crowd in this way?
Food for thought. 

4. Last but not the least, this is also something that really bothered me for hygiene purposes. Both the female cabin crew members i came in contact with, namely, Ms Deepansha and Ms. Shefali, had their admittedly beautiful LONG hair open. While serving the on-board meal to me, their hair kept coming in the way and over my food. It was majorly disturbing to see that happen, making it almost next to impossible to consume the food paid for by me. What worsened it, was the cup of water i was given. It had certain things floating in it and i couldn’t help but wonder if that was a present from the Spicejet Cabin Crew’s hair. 

Needless to say, today morning’s flight was an extremely unflattering and disappointing experience for me.
Who knew ‘Red, Hot, Spicy,’ in its truest sense stands for ‘obnoxiously inappropriate, unprofessional and rude.’ 
Maybe, just maybe, Spicejet is a tad bit TOO ‘red,hot and spicy’ for its own good.

Needless to mention, that while Spicejet airline might be low cost, their passengers ARENT. And it’s time the company realises, embraces and respects that fact.",Domestic,1.0,February 2019,16 February 2019,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The counter person was unprofessional and thought he was doing me a Favor and being condescending. If spicejet has more of these crooks, I am sure it would be a defunct airline.

Check-in: Did an over-the-counter check-in cum baggage drop. The queue was long, but the handling was efficient. Was offered an emergency exit seat, which I accepted. Extra leg space advantage gets traded off with laptop usage being discouraged in those seats.

VERY bad airline,W M Harvey,Jaipur - Ahmedabad,"I thought some of the European budget airlines like Wow and Ryan Air were bad, but Spice jet makes them look like luxury airlines in comparison. I have never dealt with more difficult and unhelpful staff. Rather than trying to find solutions to problems the airport staff just repeats themselves over and over like robots. What is the point of having staff that operate like computers? I’ve had bad experiences on airplanes but this was literally one of the worst flights I’ve ever taken. The only redeeming factor is that the seats are not horribly dirty but besides that I only have bad things to say. Fly JetAir or Air India instead.

Terrible Budget Carrier,W M Harvey,Jaisalmer - Mumbai,This airline is one of the worst I’ve ever flown with. Unbelievably incompetent staff and inflexible with their policies. I spent over $400 with them on three flights that I was unable to use because of my travel schedule and they refused to help me rebook one of my tickets to an earlier flight without paying an excessive fee even though there were seats available on the flight. I ended up having to take a taxi 200km in order to get to my final destination. DO NOT fly with them unless you have money to throw away. It does not pay to be cheap and you will be completely disappointed with the quality of the flight once you board. Fly Jet Air or Air India instead. Much much better service for a small amount more.

If this is not harassment then what is?,Sharad G,Mumbai - New Delhi,"My wife and I were booked for 8th Feb 19 by Flt SG-158 . Since the Mumbai airport closure from 7th Feb on wards  between 11 am to 5 pm for maintenance was already announced we were anticipating some rescheduling or delays.

Is it believable that bad weather at Srinagar will cause a delay of only 15 minutes-is it not misleading passengers?. Moreover only at 4.02 pm messages were sent informing more than one hour delay.

Delay spoilt all positives,Prabir G,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Mumbai,"I am travelling this morning, 31st Jan 2019, from Kolkata to Mumbai on Spicejet flight SG 488. The scheduled departure  was at 7.50 and I reached airport at 6.20. Following is my overall experience about the flight ( Rating given out of 5, 5 being the highest):-
A. Check-in: Checking at the self check in kiosk was smooth. Traveling with handbag only.(Rating 4).
B. Lounge access: I was flying economy and hence there was no lounge faculty offered. I used my Mastercard to access airport lounge.(Rating Neutral)
C. Boarding and departure: Flight was delayed. Scheduled departure was at 7.50, but flight was delayed by 49 minutes. Boarding opened at 7.50 at Gate 23B by bus. Boarding process was smooth and fast. Push back was at 8.20 and we took off at 8.40. Delay of 40 minutes (Rating 3). 
D. Seats and interior: The aircraft was a 3rd generation, Boeing 737 Max-8 series and looked new and well maintained. This type of aircraft are environment friendly, generates 14% lower carbon emissions, 50% lesser Nitrogen Oxides and 40% lower noise. The interior in Light Beige and Black looked bright and well lit. Seats upholstered in black and cherry in different rows, gives vibrancy to the overall interior. My selected seat was 17D, an aisle seat from the rear. Seat pitch was comfortable with good legspace. Seat recline was about 110 degree.(Rating 4.25).
E. In flight Service: Being no frill flight, there was hardly any in flight service offered. Food can be bought at the flight. Spicejet offers good range of hot food (Spicecafe) that can be bought. Water was made available as and when asked. In flight magazine Spiceroute provides interesting reading. (Rating 4).
F. Arrival and baggage: Flight landed at Kolkata 11.35, delay of 55 minutes from scheduled arrival (sic). Makes lot of difference in your business schedule with same day return plan. Gates were opened at 11.40. Didn't have checked in luggage (Rating 3)

"Bad experience on Spice Jt SG-354 on Jan. 29, 2019 from Kolkatta to Delhi",Jai Hari D,Kolkata (Calcutta) - New Delhi,"1. Spice jet is a low fare airline but fools customers by charging same fare as full service airline.
2. Meals/snacks/beverages were pre-booked.  but was asked to pay for beverage even though complimentary with corporate deal.
3.  Food service is so slow that middle rows have to wait for their turn only when flight is in descent mode leaving very little time for most passengers to eat.
4.  Passengers who had pre booked food/beverages should have been given preference in service, instead preference  was given for sale of food/beverage, with every possibility of pre ordered food/beverage being not available to passengers who had pre booked them depriving them of their ordered food/beverage.
5.  all seats were permanently reclined, which is a safety hazard, because they must be upright during take-off and landing.
6.  All tray tables were permanently inclined causing food tray and beverage to slide towards passenger.
7. They used old aircraft with no effort to rectify seats and improve service. it seems customer service is an alien word for them

SUDDEN SCHEDULE CHANGE,nilaksh,Jaipur - Ahmedabad,"Sudden schedule change

We were 7 friends who had gone on vacation to Savai Madhopur tiger sanctuary. We booked our return flight on SPICEJET from Ahmadabad to Jaipur & back on 3rd December.
Jaipur To Savai Madhopur traveling time is 4 hours & our return flight SG621 when booked was scheduled for 12.55 pm which was convenient to reach in time to airport from Ranthambhore.
But to our surprise we received text message that flight is rescheduled to 
7 Am which means to reach airport in time we have to leave from Ranthambhore at 1 Am & drive during night to reach airport.
We had to cancel our tickets & ended up taking indigo flight in the evening which was Jaipur-Delhi-ahmedabad & reached home at midnight and had to pay double airfare than originally booked

When we finally board the plane, the pilot announces that he doesn't feel comfortable flying the aircraft, because ""there's a problem with landing gear"". We waited nearly an hour for a mechanic to show up and look at the landing gear and other than that do absolutely nothing. I kid you not. You couldn't make it up if you tried.

Worst customer service,Tasnim Shakir,Mumbai - Ahmedabad,"You have a very immature, inexperience staff that need to be trained. The worst crew that I have seen in any of my travels. 
I usually dont put up complains on social media & I let go things but this one incident of bad customer service has never been seen or heard of in the service industry. I was travelling from Mumbai to Ahmedabad on 22nd Jan with the spicemax ticket & had ordered my meal also. I was in row 3 & the flight is about 60 mins long. The crew took 45 mins to serve first 2 rows & by the time it was to serve the 3rd row, the plane had already started the decent & the seat belt sign was on. The crew tried to serve us in a rush & was told that we will not be given hot beverage though I had requested. I was ok with that & took mango juice. Just than they served another fallow passenger with hot beverage hence i asked the crew why was I not served hot beverage though they served the other passenger. To this question of my the crew showed extreme disappoint & said that she will get it in a very rude tone. She did eventually get us coffee when the plane was almost landing. While we just took a sip of the coffee the member of the crew asked us to return on of the beverage because we were entitled to only one beverage. they infact even took the ""sipped"" coffee This shows the immaturity of the crew & the training you provide. This is totally unheard of that. Even if we were not entitled to more than 1 drink but due to the staff inefficiency they could have told us but taking back the sipped coffee is a slap to the hospital industry. Please see that the staff is well trained. paid & knows how to deal with such situations.

RUDE customer representative,Richa G,Ahmedabad - Chennai (Madras),"I would like to report an extremely rude customer representative, Deepika Chudasama, at Ahmedabad airport. My SpiceJet flight was delayed by 2 hours when travelling with my family on Friday, 18 Jan 2019 from AMD to MAA. There were 6 passengers on the itinerary including 2 little kids and 2 senior citizens.
I asked Deepika Chudasama if we could check in our carry on baggage as we were travelling with little kids, she totally ignored my request and had us put all our carry on baggage and check-in bags on the weighing machine. She even had us put our laptop bag, diaper bags (which are usually excluded with little kids) to add on the total weight. 
Deepika Chudasama kept forcing us to pay for our carry on luggage and when we told her that we would rather have our family member in Ahmedabad pick up excess luggage, she became very rude. I asked her the reason for why the flight was delayed for 2 hours as now it would be reaching Chennai at midnight instead of 10 pm and with little kids, it’s too late. Instead of showing any compassion, she made a face and said that we could go ahead and cancel our tickets if we wanted and SpiceJet would gladly refund our ticket amount. She 
She kept repeating that you want to talk about rules with me, let me show you what rules are. She added every single gram in our bags and was ticked off from the start. She treated us very rudely by using her position to demean us and repeating that I’ll show you what rules are. 

I understand that sometimes flight are delayed due to unavoidable reasons but customer representatives do not have to be so rude and reply by saying that we can go ahead and cancel our tickets. 

I have travelled with Spicejet in the past and this was by far the worse experience dealing with Deepika Chudasama at AMD airport. There needs to be some kind of training for your customer representatives on how to deal with customers and show kindness and still abide by the rules. I did not ask for any favour but the way she responded rudely is completely unacceptable.

 secondly we were 6 adults and 1 child who were travelling in economy class. it was midnight and my daughter who was having fever was feeling cold. unfortunately, i was not having anything to warm her up. on requesting for a blanket which was offered to spicemax passengers, the crew denied any blanket to non-spicemax passengers and said that one has to pay for it.
agreed, but exceptionally if a child who is not feeling well and a blanket if at all is needed which was not even used by spice max passengers, the crew bluntly denied. they were rude to such an extent that on asking for water they said you will have to purchase it. you ask anything and pat comes a rude reply.
this type of behaviour is unacceptable for such a reputed airlines. i have flown many times with spicejet never ever it has happpened. i did not know what went wrong but the crew were highly impolite and inhuman.
i would request the authorities to do the needful and also should take appropriate measures to avoid such incidents.a mature person should always be part of the crew particularly at odd hours when everyone is tired so that such delicate matters can be handled with grace and maturity.

So a representative from spicejet has come to us, while we're entering the queue and did a sales pitch: offering a premium service for INR 2000 that includes meals onboard, faster clearnace etc..I said not a rupee. after a while in the queue we got nearer to the check in counter and that's when I noticed that the spice jet personnel (a lady) at the check-in desk is doing the same sales pitch for each and every passenger. utter waste of time for others waiting in the queue.

Firstly I booked flights for my entire family of 4 from Del to Kochi and at the time of booking it was a direct flight (I never take stop over flights in domestic circuits). Just a month before the travel the airline unilaterally changed it into a stopover flight with Pune in between and conveniently adding 3hrs to the journey. With minimal other options due to increased fare I had to go through that. Secondly they charge extra for e-checkin and if you try to get seats for the family together. Another way to extract more money. Sheer fraud (since this is never mentioned upfront or in print). They use the garb of preferred seating and they call all window and aisle seats in every row from front to back as “preferred seating”.

I was also not comfortable standing for long time as I had a foot injury also.A person from spicejet team Chennai, named Mr.Prakash helped me and let me use his phone and I could contact my brother.I really appreciate his gesture.After reaching Kochi I realised that my baggage didnt come in that flight and had to wait in the airport for another 3 hours. But again when I explained my condition another staff from spicejet Mr.Inderjeet helped to get first aid for my foot and helped to get baggage.Thanks to both Mr.Prakash from Chennai spice jet staff and Mr.Inderjeet from Kochi spice jet team.

Red. Hot. Spicy.,Karen C,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,"When you take a SpiceJet flight, remember that you are not in the ""developed"" world. Check-in counter is slow. Flights run late. Passengers board on stairs, not a jet bridge. SpiceJet is a regional airline, so expect intermediate stops on the way to your final destination. Once onboard, however, service is good. Food is Indian cuisine (and can be very spicy, so ask for ""not spicy"" if you don't like heat). But the most interesting part of the flight for a Westerner is the variety of cultures one meets aboard a SpiceJet flight.

First Experience with Spice jet.,Bimal0401,Patna - Mumbai,"My first experience with Spice jet. Quick boarding helped to take off in time. However landing were delayed by 15 mts might be due to traffic on run-way. The cabin found in appropriate condition. Staff were found very helping to passengers.  

Due to economical airline, no complimentary  food or beverages served.

It has observed that number of advertisement displayed in the cabin to earn non-operating revenue. Surprisingly, Airline has not offered a small single bottle of water for such a long duration flight instead one has to purchase the same.

I am of the opinion that, at least  a small water bottle should be provided on board especially in long duration flight as passengers  are reporting to airport well in advance.

This is my first experience among all other airline that time to time announcement in cabin was helping passengers to remain updated.

Pathetic experience with spicejet,Mayank Singh,New Delhi - Mumbai,"My flight
Delhi to Mumbai 
Pnr SDLU2N and S6M8TI
Concern 1.
Delhi to Mumbai flight 
Delayed for 1 hour without any prior intimation.not informed even at check in counter
2 .When we were boarding flight we waited for cleaning staff to get down & airhostess was instead of welcoming the passengers at the rear gate was busy talking over accounts of number of supplies of cuppa noodles and biryanis 
3.I bought on board snack. Rs 300 for noodles and paper boat. give air hostess Rs 500 . She says she will come back with change . I forgot to ask for change later and so did she.i recollected when I was in bus. So spicejet earns Rs 200 by stealing money and not returning to its passenger. Isn't it the responsibility to mark seat number and return the change 
4.Delhi to Mumbai with same luggage I carried which I came back with,one hand bag and one laptop bag.On ward flight they weigh my hand bag and allow it .Return flight they weigh my laptop bag with it ,total was 9 kg for both.ask me to check in when I took only hand luggage ticket. So i pay Rs400 more. 
5.if you choose the web check-in you can't ... Coz the Seats are being sold . they block all the Seats as full or available for check in only at airport. Then why should one web check in. That's why long ques there on all counters all the time. When I went to counter they even offer ile or window .
6.the flight looks like an advertising commercial of metro or bus ... all the cabin is full of a commercial selling a brand .
I understand it's only about earning extra money from passengers for airlines. But will you ever recollect that at the end it's a hospitality industry

Worst airline ever,Atul1911,Mumbai - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Spice jet is the worst airline. They do not explicitly state that the cabin baggage is inclusive of the laptop bag and then make this as a reason to charge you a hefty amount during check in which leaves you with no option but to pay the huge sum of money to them.

Also the check in staff at Mumbai airport was really rude when confronted with the details of this rule.

Over and above this, the life jacket in the flight was removed from one of the seats. Even after repeatedly reporting it to two flight attendants, one of which was the head of the crew did not pay attention. It was left removed during the whole flight and the attendants were busy selling the snacks.

Another great find.,Simon 🙂,New Delhi - Bangkok,"When I was putting my holiday together, I googled where I wanted to go and it comes up with Spicejet amongst others. I had never heard of them along my travels, so was a little sceptical at first but the prices was very tempting and after a bit of researching I felt more optimistic. 
Now having taken all 3 flights I booked with them, I can honestly say I was more than happy. For a budget airline the seats were very comfortable and we upgraded to SpiceMax for which you get a meal, seats with extra legroom and your cases get priority treatment (on all three flights our cases came out first).
The flight crew were very helpful and friendly and the pilot had a great sense of humour as well (as we were just about to take off he said ""I hope you enjoy your flight to Mumbai and if that's not where you want to go, that's where you're going now"".
My only mistake was I didn't check the baggage allowance when I booked the tickets, so when we were checking in I had to pay a little extra, it wasn't a great fortune like certain other airlines who shall remain nameless but I do travel heavy.

DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE!!This company is rubbis!!!! Ok if you don't need to change your flight. If you do watch out!!!!!,Darren,Goa - Bangkok,"Two years in a row I needed to change my flight by two days and both times I had an absolute nightmare.

The first time it was technically my fault as I didn't check that the payment had been processed. But this is because the website is designed for people to make this mistake.

My friend later told me that you have to scroll right to the bottom of the page, a long way, and push a confirm button. He said he very nearly made the same mistake himself.

This disaster cost me 25,000 rupees as I turned up at the airport with no flight.

And when I visited a travel agency in Kolkata and told them what had happened to me they explained that they had already had two other people come in that week with the exact same scenario

The second year I changed a flight from 2/4 to 4/4. As I booked this flight through Cleartrip I could not do this on the phone for 2349 rupees administration charge. I had to travel 70 kms to the airport and pay 6000 rupees over the desk at the airport. 
After changing my flight on the phone I went onto my email and checked the itinerary and it was the new flight that I wanted. I was told to go to the airport pay the 6000 rupees and I was good to go. I was unable to print the itinerary at this time

On the way to the airport, the nextday, I stopped in an internet cafe to print out my new itinerary, which they required, and somehow the flight I now had an itinerary for was not on the 4/4 like it was the night before but 30 minutes later on the 2/4, my original date, but on a different, much longer route.

When I got to the airport I told them what happened and the fact that I had seen the correct itinerary the night before. They refused to listen to me and kept telling me that this is the flight that you have changed to. 

I kept asking them "" who pays 6000 rupees to change a flight to 30 minutes on the same day??? on a longer journey???

They then said that if I wanted to change it again to the 4/4, like I did the night before!, I would now have to pay another 2349 rupees!!

So in total I had to pay 8349 rupees to change a flight by two days. The original flight only cost me 11,000 rupees. Because of this I then said ""well don't worry about it, I will go on the 2/4 like originally planned"" I was then told ""you can't do that as we have cancelled your flight on the 2/4""  I asked them why they had cancelled my flight as I had not paid any money to change it yet??

This also fell on deaf ears!! So they basically left me in no mans land with nowhere to turn and no flight for the 11,000 rupees I had already paid!!!. By this time to book a completely new flight had gone up to 15,000 rupees.

So in the end I paid the 8349 rupees as it was the best option open to me.

After travelling 70kms back to Palolem I proceeded to sort this out with them via phone and email. They finally admitted that it was their mistake and agreed to pay me back the 2349 rupees. I said good I will pick it up at the airport the day before I fly.

""Oh no, you can't do that"" was the reply. we will refund it to the debit card you used for the original booking.

I then put the case forward that ""This money is not connected with the original booking.I paid you this 2349 rupees in cash over the counter so this is how I want it returned"" Perfectly reasonable request I thought but oh no!!

You will get it paid back to your debit card.

I HAVE STILL NEVER RECEIVED THIS MONEY BACK!!!!!!

So be warned!!

I have never used this airline since and will never do again.

I have already had the situation, three times, where I have had to pay more to go on another airline but this is the way it will be for me from now on.

Spice jet need to focus on maintenance & safety,Lakshmanan M,Goa - Chennai (Madras),"I took this afternoon flight from Goa to Chennai on 18th December 2018. 

Staff at the counter sold to me spice max at the time of checkin. I was happy to pay extra for it as it allows me extra baggage ( I did have a few kg more than the limit of 15 kg in domestic budget airlines) and also entitles priority boarding & priority baggage handling besides better seat with more legroom. 

When I boarded flight, first surprise (should I say disappointment?) was that the push back mechanism on the back rest was broken so my seat was was always leaning backwards. Captain asks you to keep the back rest straight during take off and landing. Back rest was not in control. But I was trying my best to keep my back straight most of the duration of the flight. It  is indeed a minor inconvenience for me but the concern is “how could they miss this as back rest is important for the passenger comfort and more important from safety perspective”. If they could ignore a seat in a row that they sell as spice max. How vulnerable area other seats to lose attention....?

This was seat 2D. I noticed on the other side seat number 3A which was also emergency exit was occupied by a young mother with an infant. I believe it’s not common to allot seats at emergency exit people with infants.

It was really surprising for me to see one of the reputed airline company like spice jet having such lapses on safety issues.

Harrowing experience,FlyingNotSolo,Surat - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Spice Jet service was simply awful. Firstly, within a day of booking, Spice Jet changed flight schedule by an email. This was not owing to weather as flight was booked 3 weeks before departure date. And on the actual day of travel, Spice Jet flight was delayed by many hours.this time owing to weather and missed connections. Owing to the delay, staff at Spice Jet gave us pot noodle breakfast and then offered us lunch. The lunch provided was such poor quality that some of us refused it. All along the manner of handling passengers was poor and abrasive. We have seen delays with other flights before but the staff are usually more polite and accommodating.

The staff refused to allow waiting passengers to even go to a nearby hotel at our own expenses. We told the Spice Jet staff that they could hold onto the checked in luggage or even hand it over and we could come back and then do security and check in again when the flight finally arrives. A few of us were feeling unwell but the staff flatly refused. This was not an international flight, so the refusal seemed arbitrary. Spice Jet staff refused without any reason. Calls to the Customer Care were of no use as they said Airport's Flight Staff had the discretion. This was sheer harassment to the passengers who were forcefully made to sit in one place for 10-11 hours. Almost after 8hours of waiting, we found that flight had been cancelled. Finally, we were given some respite as we managed to fly with Indigo at 21:30 hours.

SpiceMax Leg space is a joke,Madhumathi,Ahmedabad - Bengaluru,"Initially we booked a spice saver, however at the airport we upgraded to spice max. We were promised that the leg space is better in these seats. We were alloted seats 1E and 1F, however those seats were the worst. We could not even stretch our legs even a bit, infact normal seats - we could have stretched legs under the front seats. Also, the tray holder is fixed in the seat - so sitting space is very less too. This seat should not be categorized as SPICE MAX...there is nothing MAX about these seats infact was worse than regular seats. To think we paid more for these uncomfortable seats makes me cringe with dissatisfaction and a feeling of being cheated by the airlines.
The baggage restrictions of 15kgs is another irritant, min they should allow 20kgs.

The food was included in our ticket once we upgraded so it was ok, otherwise dont bother buying food.

We being seated in the front row had to hear a lot of banter from crew. Apparently they met an old friend or a colleague and they were constantly giggling or chatting, so i could not rest. I thought air hostess training includes speaking softly and not disturbing passengers.

Awful airline with the WORST.CUSTOMER.SERVICE.EVER,D W,Union Territory of Pondicherry - Bengaluru,"I booked a flight from Pondicherry to Mumbai, with a layover in Bangalore. An hour before the flight, they canceled it claiming the bad weather was causing visibility issues and the plane could not take off. Except there was no bad weather. We were then told to drive 3 hours to Chennai and book a new flight to Bengalaru and that they would NOT pay for the ride as the bad weather was not caused by the airline. What the hell?!?! At the very least, they could have delayed the flight or gotten a better plane to fly us. Or at least PAY for the drive! I've never heard of such bad customer service before and the staff dealing with this were cold and uncaring. I have never experienced such bad service or treatment before. My guess is, they were in cahoots with the drivers and probably got a cut of the money we paid to get out of Pondicherry. WILL.NEVER.FLY.WITH.THEM.AGAIN.

i ended up paying 1200 rs.. 
I had checked the weight at my home and it was exact 15 kgs..1 kg error can happen from machine to machine.. is it fair to be rigid.. i agree rules are rules but a minior can be considered..

I had asked for 2 seats togther she said pay and get it else seperate seats.. i asked her pls make it fast he has been standing since long she said who asked him to come here he should have sat down..what the hell.. is this a way to talk to a customer..i am nevr gonna travel with spicejet ever again in my life.. worst experience travelling with spicejet in my life..not a single consideration given..

On our return, we did again ask for the same seats row 1 D, E and F  as we were not at all comfortable with the bulkhead seats in our flight from Hyderabad. The online staff claimed that the seats were already allotted and we had no choice to request the staff to change to row 2 of the aircraft as recommended by the Airline staff online.

The flight was from Hyderabad to Jaipur and from Jaipur to Hyderabad. From North East India to North West India to south ( What a stupid route) When we entered the Aircraft, this Aircraft was a different configuration and actually the seats which we were allotted before changing to row 2 were the best and Exit Row seats with Ample Leg Space.

Surprisingly Good; Arguably Better Than Indigo,ShantanuNewDelhi,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),"Like many others, Spicejet is not my default option; more often it is Indigo and sometimes Vistara (if it flies on that route). My wife and I flew Spicejet to Kochi and back in early December 2018, after several years. We were taken aback by the experience which was (in almost all aspects) extremely pleasurable. We had booked ourselves on Spicemax for which there is a separate check-in counter, free meals and priority baggage clearance. But what impressed us most was the professionalism of the staff, especially the cabin crew who were outstanding. The presentation of the shopping catalogue and the on-board dining menu are superb, and the items offered on each are good too. Most importantly, the flights to and fro were bang on time. 

The only disappointment was the weighing scale at Kochi which I thought was suspect but I have no proof. Secondly, our baggage was the last to arrive when we landed at Delhi. I was refunded Rs 100 after I submitted an online complaint, and while it is a paltry sum considering two of us were affected it was nevertheless a welcome gesture.

I will now seriously consider Spicejet ahead of Indigo, whose arbitrariness and money-minded approach has put me off. I recommend others consider Spicejet too.",Domestic,5.0,December 2018,17 December 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worst airline...do not buy spicemax,Mimmy2014,Dubai - Pune,"I am a regular international traveler......but this was the worst experience of all.

I had purchased Spicemax....which gives priority for boarding, additional luggage..etc..and still I had to go through this.

At boarding...staff was weighing luggage of every passenger. I can understand, they want to check if any passenger is carrying extra weight than the limit.
I went through that, went to the gate below, where bus was standing to take passengers to the flight.
Again here, staff was weighing luggage and with additional drama.
in 2 minutes, why do they need to weigh again and again.
For me, they didn't weigh, but told me that aircraft is full and does not have space in cabin for anymore luggage. I got agreed and left my luggage with them. 
Then I heard conversations staff was doing with other passengers.
One passenger was told, he is carrying additional luggage (already luggage WT was checked upstairs...and it was okay there)
Another one was told, you are carrying 3 bags, whereas he had paid for his extra luggage and he was showing the recipes of the same.
Another lady and her daughter was told  they are carrying 2 bags....so one should be left here.

WHAT is all this?? what for????
Worst! Worst!!

Amazing was bus went before us had all passengers with at least one bag per person.

We surely will not be booking Spicejet again . and recommend others to book others flight in stead of this as this will ruined your journey . 
I also want to mention one more thing the air hostess were so causal about their duty instead of saying hello to passengers while onboard they were talking among themself.what a local flight .

And we could only empathize with those passengers and their outrage... Then there was a SpiceJet flight to Pune which was late... So the passengers of all these three flights were simply stranded at the airport and were given zero compensation in terms of either airfare or food / drinks...

Time To Bring About A Change,Pankaj Varma,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"I have personally never been a fan of Spicejet Airlines since its inception primarily due to the fact that their services on ground and in air left a lot to be desired. The way they used to address people initially near the boarding gate was nothing less than rude and it always looked like they were running behind schedule. .Had almost stopped travelling on Spicejet till recently when we had to fly to Delhi due to an emergency. Needless to say that the price of our tickets went through the moon. On reaching the airport well in advance,  the ground staff at the airport offered us two front seats on their own saying that the seats at the back are not together and that the front seats are more comfortable etc. The price quoted was 1000 per seat (and they promised 2 meals free along with that). We bargained a bit and their staff agree for an amount of  Rs. 1000 for 2 seats. On boarding the flight, we were made to feel as if we are basically a burden and there was no customary greetings et all. It took the attendant almost more than an hour to come to us with a meal as they were attending a couple of other customers. Never have I seen an airline taking so long to serve just about 3 to 4 passengers in the front.  Then there was a small discussion about the meals and they said that we are entitled to just one meal. With great difficulty, we managed to convince the staff that we were entitled to two meals.
The meals came in another 15 minutes and it was actually the most shoddy packaging  I have ever seen in a long time. The packaging was coming off from corners, the cutlery was missing in one of the meals, one meal had a dip missing. Except for one dish, the other dishes were so cold. To eat one of the dishes was an ordeal in itself as it  had become quite hard.   The only good thing was that it was a brand new plane and the landing was real smooth . Kudos to the pilot for the same.

Its time for Spicejet to really look into the areas where they can improve upon and bring about the necessary changes which can put them on par with the rest. I believe that they should brief their staff and teach them about the ways to conduct themselves in front of people. I am sure a smile will surely not cost them much and in turn will ease out the stress.",Domestic,2.0,October 2018,23 November 2018,3.0,3.0,N/A,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0

Spicejet does not keep to its schedules,Aparajita J,Dehradun - Mumbai,"3 out of 4 times that I have flown Spicejet, they have changed the flight time.

* Delhi Mumbai - flight was delayed by 1 hour
* Dehradun Mumbai - flight was cancelled. Fortunately, they gave me an option to book a different flight, which I did. This flight was later 'preponed' according to an email they sent me, however it took off late!
In my opinion, this airline is notoriously unreliable in terms of keeping to its scheduled departures.
On the positive side, they detected a lighter in my check in bag. Although it hardly had any fuel in it, the lighter is a restricted item.

"First SpiceJet Experience: Revenue and rules centric, not customer oriented",Sanjay D,Jabalpur - Mumbai,"- Pre-booked Priority check-in, and excess baggage of 10kg on a flight from Jabalpur. 
- The pre-booking Online process itself took multiple attempts and my account was had a double charge 
- Did not notice any ‘special process’ geared for priority checking except for a sign. My money felt wasted, it did not even work for priority boarding.
- Despite pre-booking 10kg excess weight, the absence of hand baggage was not adjusted for calculating extra weight. This was a first time experience in 30 years of my travel. We hadn’t prepared our ‘hand baggage’ to suit the rules of the airline.
- The rate of excess weight was just 5% more than what I paid for in pre-booking, making me wonder why the hell did I go thru’ the whole pre-booking process.

 Clearly the airline seems un-geared to bring value for the much touted and marketed Add-Ons, and the Check-in staff is groomed to stubbornly stick to rules, as against spirit for customers.

Yes, the airline can argue that they went by the book in every point above; but having a discretion is what distinguishes a customer friendly airline from a revenue friendly rule-based one.",Domestic,2.0,November 2018,18 November 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Extremely poor concern for customer feedback,Piyush Shah,Dubai - Pune,"Had to forcefully travel on Spice Jet recently from Dubai to Pune. 

Before the check in, you've to pass the 'weight test' and the airline seemed more interested in troubling it's passengers than resolving the issue. 

Mr Vishnu Prasad, Supervisor @ the airport representing Spice Jet made the passengers read the fine print 'lap top weight is included in the 7kg cabin luggage'. Bizarre.....Have been traveling on different airlines for a number of years & never ever has this happened where the 'passengers  are shown to read the fine print for cabin baggage'. No consideration even  for passengers flying frequently on Spice Jet. 

Mr Vishnu mentioned, 'we have given our feedback to our management for relaxing cabin baggage regulations especially for flights from Dubai due to large number of passengers buying at Duty free shops on Dubai Mumbai & Dubai Pune sectors, however, feedback from the management is  awaited'. 

While he was doing his duty, he pleaded his helplessness to most of the passengers which included a few ladies. 

It was indeed surprising to observe Spice Jet does not charge its passengers for serving water & allowing them to use the lavaratories on the flight!!!!!

They are charging for checkin bag, you can carry only hand bag. if your carrying checkin bag you have to pay for that as per the weight. For most of the airlines you can carry checkin bag upto 15kg with free of cost . In spice jet the seat arrangements are very compact as compared to other airlines, you can't stretch your legs properly. There will be no complementary food in spice jet you have to pay for food . most of the airlines provides food as complementary . The most important thing is the behaviour of the crew & airport staff , they don't know how to treat the customers , they are very rude. Don't carry any fragile thing in your baggage , because they don't how to handle your belongings even your paying for the baggage.",Domestic,1.0,November 2018,14 November 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Hence, we went ahead and booked the jet airways tickets instead, since the customer relations team at Spicejet isn’t allowed to talk to customers. It’s now been 8 days since I raised me request, still haven’t been able to hear back from Ms Priya Chettri, the customer relations team exec. She’s not reachable on the phone even to her own Spicejet colleagues. On the other hand, indigo canceled the full related itinerary overnight due to the emergency. I’ve provided all necessary documentation, also Spicejet is well aware that the medical emergency occurred due to them deplaning us after making us sit for 1.5 hours on a flight that they decided to cancel after all. This caused us to change our entire itinerary, spend 12 hours at the airport, and do an additional 3 hour drive (with no support from Spicejet ground staff for the additional cost of driving at midnight) to reach our actual destination which Spicejet couldn’t arrange for us to reach.

100% never again to Spicejet,Joy dad,Dubai - Jaipur,"Allow me share my experience,Recently flew with spicejet on 9th October ( SG 58) from Dubai to Jaipur. It was the worse experience ever in my life and embarrassing too while traveling Internationally 5/6 times in a year. 

While check-in I was told I can carry 7 KG hand bag. There was my laptop in it and a DSLR camera and a lens. It was less than 6 KG. So I bought Chocolate and 2 liquors from Dubai duty free. After boarding gate open they found my hand bag is more than 7 KG and I was asked to pay 180 dirham from a unprofessional staff as I had 3 KG extra.
Honestly I was surprised and enquired about it when I have only ine laptop and camera and two bottles of liquor of duty free products.It was too embarrassing infront of all passengers, So I refused to pay and wanted to speak with supervisor or incharge. But the situation became more worse when that gentle man came with a huge attitude. Without even knowing the situation he behaved like I stole something and was get caught. I dont wanna write his name, but the way I was told was not acceptable at all. I tried to explain that even in the check in counter no one told me about laptop and duty free products would be count. His final words were throw the bottles if I dont want to pay.
May be he was doing his job in his stubborn way but trust me never faced this situation ever. I dont know any airline even bother to check the weight of laptop and camera with duty free products. Spicejet company made my dream true and showed the reality.

Upto this point it was fine. Then we haf to wait at the aircraft till 3.45 pm. There was no proper announcement. We were first told that due to deicing requirement flight will leave at 2 pm. Didn't happen. Everytime passengers created noise we were told it will happen soon and not in their control. In the meantime all other flights took off. Pilot announced at 2.45 pm flight will take off in few minutes. That slso did not happen. Ultimately we took off at 3.45. In the process I missed my connecting flight to Kolkata due to leave at 5 pm.

Budget airline with better service & on time flight services,Nshaikh9,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"After almost a month of office work in Bengaluru, it was time to get back to the mainland — this time in the back of the plane. The SG-635 flight from Bengaluru gets you to Mumbai.  After some searching, I found a solid deal so I jumped on this fare & booked, where I got huge discount which made the deal more irresistible. 

My check-in experience was quicker & easier than normal. I breezed through security (though it was a bit crowded) & popped in to the departure zone to have a snack, sip a coffee & shop before the flight. I had left early than my flight time in order to give myself ample time at the airport. My flight had gate no 04 assigned to it, which was at ground level. I walked a long way away from the assigned gate browsing through the shops checking the Indian artifacts & other stores in the airport. 

I was inside the flight at around 14.45, now with confirmation that my flight was right on time. Scanning for seat no 14F (thank you spicejet for a window seat) I realized that the aircraft was a bit old, but the economy cabin is legit. The flight attendants were friendly during boarding and meal services.

The flight was completely full, I could tell that the seats were a nice step-up from your average economy seat on a widebody aircraft. Each seat had a footrest, an adjustable headrest. When the passenger front of me reclined all the way back, I didn’t get claustrophobic, & I was able to straighten my legs almost completely through the footrest & under the seat in front of me (I do have short legs, but this was great). It was a pretty standard economy experience seatwise.

A. Check-in: Checking  was smooth and reasonably fast (Rating 4).
B. Lounge access: I was flying economy and hence there was no lounge faculty offered. I used my Mastercard to access airport lounge(Rating Neutral)

Barring little commotion at the congested basement departure hall, Boarding process was smooth and fast. The departure was delayed by 15 minutes due to early morning congestion at Kolkata Airport and we finally took off at 6.20 am. (Rating 4).

My selected seat was 2F, a window seat at the front. Seat pitch was reasonably good with comfortable faux leather upholstery. Much comfortable than all its peer airlines. Seat recline was about 120 degree, not bad for economy class(Rating 3.5).
E. In flight Service: My seat was booked under corporate booking and breakfast was included in the service.

Unprofessional and bad attitude,AmorKotum,Dubai - Mumbai,"Let me start by saying that service providers must remember that one unprofessional staff can ruin the reputation of the entire brand & experience and the company cannot excuse themselves from the bad recruitment.
My husband and I were traveling to Mumbai. At Dubai airport terminal 1, we were offered the upgrade to SpiceMax for 80 AED per adult. It would include seats with more leg room & a meal & priority boarding. We paid and took the offer. When it came time for boarding, the representative at the boarding gate was announcing for SpiceMax passengers. We went forward and showed our boarding pass. The representative named SARAN said we are not SpiceMax passengers which got us confused. So we waited. But then we heard that all the other economy passengers were called. So my husband found the receipt and went to show it to him. Saran then confirmed that we were indeed SpiceMax passengers but with absolutely no apology or regret or the courtesy to lead u to the queue and let us go in first before the economy passengers. My husband asked his name and his response was to show his badge with a sarcastic reply by spelling his name out to my husband. It threw us off and left a bad impression about the airline.

Breakfast menu served at 12 pm ???,Ajay Kacker,New Delhi - Goa,"Travelled from Delhi to Goa on the 1130 flight from Delhi.

Had booked Spicemax option for seats and food benefits.

At the time of booking, I had clearly asked what would be served, it was mentioned lunch.

 Imagine my surprise, on the actual flight, when we were categorically told that breakfast was picked up and not lunch, because pick up of food was  done prior to 11:30. Not willing to create a scene with the airhostess or otherwise, we quietly agreed and had omelette and Vadas at 12:30 pm !!!! 

I do not understand what has pick up time to do with actual flight requirement. Why couldnt lunch menu be prepared before 11:30 ??

Seats were ok.

Take off and landing too were smooth.

Abondoned,649amic,Guwahati - Patna,"I had a very bad experience with SpiceJet and I would like to bring it to your notice. 

On Thursday 20th of September 2018 myself, my wife, my sister-in-law, my daughter, and my granddaughter flew SpiceJet flight number SG658 from Guwahati to Kolkata. 

We had a connecting flight SG377 from Kolkata to Patna. 

Because the flight from Kolkata departed late (departure time was 3.20pm when original booking was done on Tue 15 May 2018 but later changed to 3.45pm) we had very little transfer time at Kolkata (ETD 6.15 pm). 

My seats- GAU/CCU 27F, CCU/PAT 27F

On arrival at Kolkata we disembarked from the aircraft with all the passengers and I started to look for a SpiceJet staff member to help us in boarding our next flight. When I spotted a SpiceJet employee at the end of the building at the ground level, I approached her with my family members and asked for her help for the next flight. I told her that we were foreigners and did not know where to go. I wanted to know where was gate 19 and how to get there. Her only reply was go to the right. No other information was given. I asked her again direction for gate 19 and she replied go to the right. She was talking to a gentleman and her body language said she did not like me interrupting her. Not receiving any helpful information from her, we went into the building where others were collecting their baggage. I approached a complete stranger and asked him to help us find gate 19. He very kindly pointed to the lift and told us to go one level up. If only the SpiceJet staff had told us in the first place to take the lift upstairs and go through two sets of security checkpoints before going to gate 19, which was the last gate to the right. My wife cannot walk fast because she has issue with her feet and we were getting more and more frustrated. There was not even one SpiceJet staff to help us. When I finally reached the check-in counter after security clearances and running some 600 meters, I told one of the staff that my family was stuck at the second security checkpoint and for him to go and see if they have managed to go through the security so that we do not miss our next flight to Patna. By this time I was so tired that I could hardly talk. I am 76 years old and I get stressed very easily. I have travelled all over the world and to India nearly every 2nd year since 2002. I feel I have never been insulted so badly by any aviation personnel previously. I can say this with conviction because I have worked in Civil Aviation industry for 20 years.

Try and put yourself in my situation. I am a foreigner in a strange country. I have my family with me and we are desperately looking for gate 19 in order not to miss our flight to Patna. We have a connecting flight and I do not have the vaguest idea whether the airline will wait for us or not. There not a single SpiceJet staff to guide or help us. They were very quick in taking 2700 rupees for a couple of kilograms extra luggage at Guwahati airport.

The check in staff at Kolkata airport left and I waited for my family to come and join me before boarding the aircraft. We were the last ones to board. I was very upset because the only SpiceJet employee we saw and who could have helped us was far too busy beautifying herself and having a deep conversation with a male. We are foreigners and we do not know the layout and the procedures at Kolkata airport. A little bit of help from this lady would have saved us all that stress and pain. As soon as I boarded the Aircraft I told the lady who was welcoming the passengers on the aircraft that I wanted to make an official complaint regarding our treatment at call Kolkata airport. I told her what had happened and all she said was ""I am sorry"". 

It is my opinion that when SpiceJet became aware of the delayed flight from Guwahati, at least some effort should have made to ensure passengers transferring to Patna were given help especially when they are foreigners. I am very hurt and disappointed with SpiceJet ground staff for not helping us when we were lost at Kolkata airport. I hope some action is taken to avoid a similar occurrence in future.  

And please ask your ground personnel making PA announcements not to scream but to speak softly and slowly so that we can understand what is being said.

Use of ladders to board the aircraft is very difficult for us older generation. And your staff do not help much but give dirty looks.

When I objected, she stated that I was free to complain to the management.My question is that if the Air hostesses  have already the passenger manifest wherein our non veg preference was clearly spelt out, what prevented them from collecting some non veg meals from Bagdogra or have some more quantity from Kolkata itself from where the flight had originated( it was a return flight) or whether they more interested in selling these off aginst cash at a higher price.I am so fed off by the callous attitude of the aircraft authorities that I have decided against Spice Jet in future wherever possible and Spice Max in particular.",Domestic,2.0,August 2018,24 September 2018,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

Team member like her is always an asset to any organisation (Specially Hospitality industry).Sruthy will surely get motivated with such feedback and it will surely encourage her to continue to strive towards excellence.

One small advice, passenger, especially who belongs to hospitality industry, always notice the standards what they expect for. I did not feel any warmth hospitality in the flight at all; however check in experience was good. Cabin crew should be more trained to follow the hospitality standard, which comes first-that is smile.

Good in-flight but hidden costs if you are trying to book seats online,siddharth s,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"While booking my flight - SpiceJet with its strong performance and good reviews became my defect choice for the airline. 
My experience is as below. 

Booked through an aggregator (I think it was cleartrip) Logged in to SpiceJet once I had a PR and tried to webscheckin. Here is where the fun started.
""Web check-in begins 48 hours before the flight’s departure time. It closes 2 hours before the departure time"". For a flight booked in 2 months in advance, I now needed to set a reminder to reserve my seats 48 hours in advance. @SpiceJet - please open the webcheckin as soon as a flight booking is open!

Cut to 48 hours: God forbid if you are accessing the website through the phone - scrolling freezes! Unfortunately I was travelling in a bus and then had to borrow a laptop to book the seat. Surprise - only the middle aisle is not charged. Rest is charged. Was not expecting this. Indigo / Jet also charge for seats but nothing like this. Paid for the seats through the website and somehow the screen went blank. Luckily was able to log in and retrieve my tickets. 

Flight Day: The on-ground staff is very courteous and very very friendly. For a 5 am flight, they were cheerful and trying as much as they could to help the passengers (Unlike Indigo, who behave as if they are doing a favour). Hostess and Stewards were very friendly and put a smile on my kids face. Loved their attitude. When we ran in turbulence, they helped people with kids.

However I may fly them again (if they open their web check-in options) and I also liked their Max option which I will try sometime in the future.",Domestic,5.0,August 2018,17 September 2018,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Hand baggage only Fare type- perforce collection of additional charges,sudeb gupta,Mumbai - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Travelled recently from Kolkata to Mumbai and back to Kolkata from Mumbai under Hand Baggage only Fare Type.

highly not recommanded.,Gautam S,Hyderabad - Jaipur,"Many time I had a terrible experience but I had to travel via SpiceJet if it is in my budget. If there is another flight I would suggest to go with that.

First terrible experience was when they forced me to take spice max and pay for it. When i reached to counter they said all economy seat is filled so you will have to take spice max which would cost 1000. I argued for almost 15 min that why to pay extra when I opted for normal seat and how come seats can be filled when i bought a tkt. they asked me to either take spice max or leave the flight. No manager came when i asked to call him. I had to pay with no other choice.

Second teriible experience when they didn't allow me to board. I reached to airport 1 hour before. I directly went to an executive guy and asked him that I am little bit late as gate will close 45 min before. He asked me to be in queue and wait for my turn. that's ok. when my turn came it was 46min left. The counter guy first took my tkt and ids and then check his watch and said - sorry the gates are closed you can't take this flight. He started expailing me about another flight without asking. I fought saying that its still 45 min but nothing worked. He want me to book next flight. I came out and took indigo flight of next day. I slept on airport and got cold as well.",Domestic,2.0,May 2018,17 September 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

(20-9-18) and landed in Chennai international airport at 4 am . As we have a connecting flight from Chennai to hyderabad which is scheduled at 6 am did our web check-in. Spicejet have not took responsibility in delivering the checkin baggage soon and  they took almost 45mins to dispatch our check-in baggage , when we asked a spicejet personal he is  not responding and he said wait till u get ur baggage it's not our responsibility  the supportive team will come, No one turned up or even seen near the baggage belt . Spicejet supportive staff should take up some responsibility and  talk to there customer and explain the issues they r facing in providing the check in baggages. There is almost ample amount of time for us to go to domestic terminal and checkin happily but due to spicejet people delay we got late for connecting flight for which we rushed to domestic airport with 2 year old kid which is so hard and risky .
Spicejet team should feel some responsibility in communicating with there customer . Being a reputed airlines in india take some care towards customers.

Booking done in Makemytrip - Flight Sector Cancelled by Spicejet *Atrocious Attitude*,Mohan R,Amritsar - Bengaluru,"BOOKING ID: 22697128175291
I booked for 9 passengers in July2018 for flight on 1st Sep flight from Amritsar to Bengaluru via Makemytrip. Till 1st Sep morning, I called Spicejet to do web-checkin, I was not informed by not even 1 single person from Spicejet. They told me, they sent me email and message on 12th Aug about Termination of this sector. What baffled me was they kept my money of Rs 44000 without refunding, after so called informing as per them on 12th Aug. Even makemytrip washed off its responsibility to rebook another flight and I had to spend an additional Rs 15000 extra due to last minute change of flight. Overall, I strongly suggest not to fly with Spicejet - absolutely careless attitude towards customers. More importantly, we may need to check multiple times before the original travel, if these airlines keeps any changes and does not inform the travellers. I had a small kid 8 yrs old and senior citizen aged 75years. How could spicejet telephone centers cannot make one single call and inform me about cancellation of sector.

Yes, it was the first time I have booked it in SJ. But, the in-flight experience was not that good. 

One of the hostess Ms Solanki was discourteous and insensitive in her approach to the passengers. 

The key issue is that she was rude on people who wanted to use the lavatory urgently. 

Even though there was an announcement on turbulence in the middle, she didn't allow people ever after several minutes. 

Few of us want to suffer without relieving oneself. So, the whole experience of flying 3 hours was spoiled. 

She should have been courteous and also must intimate people once the normalcy returned. 

But, she was too busy selling stuff and not concerned about passengers agony. (I'm not sure whether she had a proper training and not even doesn't have proper accent and smile)

But Spicejet didn't, and they charged extra for hand baggage too which in total actually cost me more than the actual flight ticket.
I regret later on why I chose this flight.
Even in my corporate meal I have to ask them for the beverage which they ignored initially and when I asked upon for my beverage in corporate meal it's been answered ""let me check and I'll get back to u"" and then finally offered me it. Means are they trying to be smart or they don't even know the basics of their services!!

Average Experience,Arun Bhagat,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"Recently travelled from Bangaluru to Mumbai in first week of July. My personal experience was not so good kind of. We had been traveling as a group of 12 passengers and have a combined ticket. We tried to check in well before more than 2 and half hours, so no crowd at the counters. Just an hour earlier we travelled from Lucknow to Bangalore on GoAir but we did not have excess luggage problem but at SpiceJet Counter the lady shocked us by saying we have excess of appx 20 kha and need to pay Rs. 12000 odd amount. We tried to convince her about our prior flight and the same luggage was there with us with no addition. But the ladies at counter did not budge. We even tried convinced her about our hand baggage which was average 4 Ks per person... But nothing to avail. Finally we paid Rs. 4000 to settle the matter after transferring most of the items to hand baggage. All this was happening at the counter for 30 minutes. We had to open our bags in the queue to transfer the luggage to hand baggage. A horrible experience.... To add to the agony the flight was delayed around 1.5 hrs than the scheduled departure.

The flight looked ok but the leg room was not enough to accommodate a tall person and found inconvenient... The in flight service was ok not matching to international standards...

Before the journey SpiceJet rties to call you and sell a Rs1000 package for meal, extra bag and choice of seat.  I did not find any need for it.

In the flight, there are product advertisements, which is irritating.  But from next time onward, I will just plug in my headphones and ignore these announcements and reject the marketing calls.

Refreshing change,Nikhil C,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bengaluru,"One of the rare occasions where I had to fly SpiceJet since my other 2 preferred carriers didn't have any options around the same time of my travel. Since my travel time is more than 2 hours for any trip, I prefer not to take chances with any other airline. SpiceJet was a chance that I took and was a mixed experience of sorts. The start off wasn't very great, since the take off was delayed by 30 mins, which eventually was covered up and we reached our destination on time. 

Coming to the inflight service, most of the airline companies don't provide with options for the onboard corporate meals. It's mostly a packed meal box having a dry sandwich with a tetrapack juice, making the entire experience go down south. I was hoping for the same with SpiceJet and was pleasantly surprised that they had more options to choose from, right from hot meals to subs and ready to eat options. I opted for one of their hot meals and was served promptly hot and fresh, surely a thumbs up from my side. 

They need to work on a few minor aspects, their inflight entertainment- SpicEngage wasn't up, though each of the headrests had them prominently displayed, that was one disappoinment there, wash rooms needed cleaning, overall the cabin was clean, staff was polite and courteous, landing was smooth as was the overall experience.

Flight cancellation and harrowing time at Bangkok airport,teemsaj,Bangkok - New Delhi,"Me & my family suffered as our flight from Bangkok to Delhi on Spicejet (SG 088 departing at 3:50 AM) got cancelled due to a crack in the cockpit windscreen. Spicejet doesn't have any alliance with any airline - so no other flight was offered, other than their own same flight (SG 088) the day after. No assistance was offered by Spicejet – there was only one staff member to handle 100+ passengers. 

I could not spend another couple of days with my family in Bangkok who were already exasperated & miserable due to the delay first for about three hours (from around 3:50 AM to 7 AM Thailand time) and finally the cancellation announcement (around 7 AM) of the late night flight. Note that we reached the airport 3 hours before flight departure time – so we were at the airport from around 12:30 AM till about 9 AM (taking into account clearing immigration again, and finding a hotel near the airport and then booking it while at the airport only) - a total of more than 7 hours. My wife couldn't sleep and my son was crying. I also was shivering due to the air-conditioning and had to take a quick decision and booked an alternate flight on Thai Airways for Rs 76000 for 3 persons (since it was a last minute booking) - which was the cheapest direct flight showing at that time. 

Though Spicejet refunded the airfare for Bangkok to Delhi sector and offered compensation as per current laws which is Rs 10,000 or base fare + fuel surcharge : whichever is lower (basic fare was lower in our case and there was no fuel surcharge). I still ended up losing Rs 25,000 on new flight ticket cost alone. ICICI Lombard travel insurance did not honour the claim stating that flight cancellation due to ""technical reasons"" is not covered. One of the prime reasons for taking travel insurance is for flight cancellation. Flight cancellation & interruption cover of ICICI Lombard is only applicable if flight is cancelled due to - Earthquake, Storm, flood, inundation, cyclone, tempest, fog (optional cover) and Terrorism. 

PS The inconvenience faced and seeing your family suffer - are something that no airline or insurance policy will cover. Rights of average Indian traveller are very limited, and we are left at the mercy of big corporations.",Asia,4.0,June 2018,18 July 2018,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0

BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,יניב ר,Dharamsala - New Delhi,"On June 7th 2018 I flew with Spice Jet from Dharamsala to Delhi
Upon arrival I was told that my bags did not arrive with us as they were not put on the plane.
I had to take another flight back home to Israel and could not wait for the bags to arrive the following day as I would miss my connection.
After speaking to numerous representatives (none of which seem to be able to help me – or didn’t want to) as they continuously pass me to a different representative each time. After sending all the required documents to Spice Jet I was finally promised that I had sent you all the relevant information in order to receive our bags.
It was then brought to my attention that I also require a travel certificate from the airline I flew with back to Israel.
It’s as if Spice Jet is doing everything it can in order not to send my luggage to Israel.
I have yet to receive a plausible explanation as to why this is so difficult to send two bags to Israel (mine and my wife’s) 
This is absurd and frustrating that it has to take so long to get my luggage.
We had a wonderful time in India on our honeymoon and it took one bad experience with spice Jet (which is still continuing to this day) to leave on a bad note of our time spent in India

It has now been more than a month since we returned from India and we still haven’t received our bags or any semblance of assistance in this matter.
It has become a daily routine to call and hope that some one on the other end will call (which never happens).

Horrible Experience,Avinash P,Gorakhpur - New Delhi,"I had Spice Jet flight from Gorakhpur to Delhi on July 07 , 2018.I really regret taking this Spice Jet flight from Gorakhpur, U.P. It was horrible experience and I would never fly again with Spice Jet in my life.It starts with checkin of my baggage . When reached to the counter , the Spice Jet staff (Mr.Aman) asked me to take my baggage to the other side and he needs to weigh it separately. Then he kept me waiting for at least 45 minutes. While waiting on the counter, I was witnessing How Mr Aman and other staff were rude to other customers as well. They were treating like if u want to fly , you need to obey them..otherwise you'll be left behind. Even for small small questions, they were getting frustrated and were responding to customers so arrogantly that customers were quite frightened. Spice Jet, you need to understand that most of the travelers who reach airport will be in state that they have been delayed. As responsible service provider, you need to console them they need not to worry ..rather them scolding them why are they late and they will be left behind. There was one lady with a kid who wasn't having any ID as still she was so young to have any aadhar card or any form of ID. And Mr Aman was was scolding like either you bring the ID or you'll be barred to get inside the flight. After the Argument , station manager Mr GK Singh arrived, and he was super rude as compare to Mr Aman. Even Mr GK Singh threatened that lady to throw out of the airport with the help of security personnels. Dude , there are better ways to handle the situation, at least you can be calm and explain the rules politely. Why are you being so rude and arrogant? And then there were travelers with baggage having extra weights. At this point Mr Aman has his staff were showing their true face. They were bargaining customers to pay extra INR 2400 even if the weight is 1 KG extra. and then slowly they will lower the rate to 2000, then 1500, 1000 etc. With one customer, they settled down for INR 500 only? Spice Jet, if you have a really rule and policy for baggage ..then why are you negotiating with price? Is this the way you loot customers? I'm flying for last 10 years , and have never seen such kind of bargaining with luggage price at the airport. Every airlines either they show some courtesy to allow the baggage or they charge some fixed price . They never negotiate . Then why some different rule at Gorakhpur station ? Are these Spice Jet staff at Gorakhpur station getting some commission based on how much they have looted customers ? There was one traveller who told clearly that rather he will throw the stuff rather than paying INR 2400 for them as they are worth of very less. And He started arranging his stuff and taking out some boxes which were un-important. At this point station Manager GK Singh would come to that passenger and threatened him that his baggage will not be scanned again if he doesn't pack the bag within 5 minutes? Dude, again arrogance ..why ? Can't you be nice to passenger ?  And when my turns come , I was well prepared what I need to do. When Mr Aman weighed my baggage , it was 1.5 KG extra weight.Mr Aman quoted me INR 2400 for the extra weight. I asked him to weight and took out 2 boxes of sweets which I was taking to US for my friends. I gave those sweets to other airport staff. After that my baggage was under 15 KG. While I was arranging my stuff, again Station Manager Mr GK Singh came to me and threatened that within 5 minutes I need to complete checkin other wise they will close the door. Some how I packed all my stuff and was able to get inside the flight just 5 minutes before. Though I have reached airport 1 hour before and there were passengers who came after me, but were able to get inside the flight before me.
This was really horrible experience and would regret taking Spice jet flight from Gorakhpur airport.Spice Jet , you need to really train your Gorakhpur Airport staff ,make them to visit at other airports and show them how nicely other airlines staff behave at all other airports. 
I think this problem is only with Gorakhpur Airport as its being a new airport with fewer flights, staff are in the typical mind set of like typical Government office staffs Spice jet , if you think  because there are not enough competitors, you can act and behave the way you want.

Beware! The NEW SpiceJet may catch you unaware.,PurePahari,New Delhi - Mumbai,"So the point is, when the competition hits hard and margins squeeze, fuel prices increase and so on, what does an airline do - resort to service degradation? That is what I felt on my recent flight from New Delhi to Mumbai on June 21st, 2018.

I booked tickets for two through EaseMyTrip dot com (who should share a part of the blame) in good faith, and just like most Indians went for the 'best deal' and time that suited my convenience. Did a web check in prior to the trip as well - all In Good Faith. Atleast one week prior to the trip I started getting a whole series of marketing SMS and phone calls from their executives trying to push me hard for upgrades, add ons and what not (none of which I needed nor bought). Upon reaching the check in counter and handing over my - well within limit - one check in bag per ticket, within 15 kgs limit, the lady at the counter again first pitched an upgrade at an extra charge which I politely said no to. What followed was shocking - I was told that I need to pay Rs. 800 to check in the two bags since there was NO check in baggage allowed on my ticket!! I was zapped completely since nowhere in this whole while I was at all aware or made aware of (this could have been done instead of sales pitch for upgrades) either by SpiceJet or EaseMyTrip. Infact this was the first time I got to know of a provision of no check in baggage. I only felt cheated. Moreover the lady at the airport was impolite and seemingly unhappy that my not going for upgrades. A better handling may have helped.

My advice on the above: Double check your air tickets hereon when travelling by SpiceJet or any other low cost carrier so as to avoid unpleasant surprises. 

Two, possibly it was a bad day for the airline and me - there was a piece of charcoal in my food (bought a chicken tikka roll). My idea not being harassing the staff or being rude in any matter, I quietly showed the sample to the flight attendants, took a few pictures and they acknowledged the problem. Yes, such things can happen accidentally - but better checks are required especially when you are running a mega brand and not a restaurant.

"Not Very Great , Not bad either",Shanbhag,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"I flew SG197 recently from Delhi - Bangalore. Check in at Delhi was smooth. Boarding was done before the time printed on boarding gate with out any announcement & intimation, hence people were confused . Pilot announced before time departure once the gate was closed & the flight was stranded in take off que for more than 40 minutes with out any announcement & passengers were informed only when we reached no 2 in que.

Gamble with your peace of mind at your own risk!,Vishwesh_Katakkar,Dubai - Pune,"I am a frequent airline traveller and have taken hundreds of flights with several airlines. In general, I find SpiceJet OK. 
This particular experience of mine is regarding my latest flight from Dubai to Pune on 26th June. We had been travelling together as a family and had prebooked prepaid Spicemax seats 3A,3B and immediate seats behind us 5A,5B as seen on the seat map(No row 4 on the seat map). Unfortunately, when we entered the aircraft, there was a row 4 present and the family wasnt willing to shift. More surprisingly, while SpiceMax seats are advertised to be with extra legroom, there was NO such difference on this aircraft. Anyways, being a red-eye flight, we didnt have the patience to argue over it. 
We had also pre-booked and pre-paid the kids meals for our 2 children. Surprisingly at meal time, the air hostess informed that there was no such booking reflected on our 3A,3B seats. Since I didnt have the pre-paid meal confirmation printout, I coudlnt argue with her though I asked her to cross check several times since I was very sure I had paid for it. Surprisingly, at the end of meal, she returned and handed over 1 meal apologetically saying she had 'forgotten' about it. She still insisted that there was no additional Kids meal reflecting on her manifesto. I was surprised that my other child did receive the said pre-paid meal but one was missing. Ofcourse it created a rift amongst my two kids to share one Kids meal. I still decided to remain clam and avoid any arguments since I couldnt access my emails while on the flight to show the confirmation nor did I carry a printout(I doubt anyone does that but now learnt to do it the hard way). 
On arrival, I checked my emails and confirmed my suspicion that I had indeed pre-booked and paid correctly and I had been denied my paid service! I decided to raise the matter to SpiceJet by writing to their customer relations helpdesk and was sure that this issue will be resolved quickly since I had all the correct proof. 
Lo and behold, received a reply from Spicejet after a few days that they had checked the matter and that they had handed over the second Kids meal to my wife!!!! I mean how stupid can this answer be! It implied I had not checked with my wife before raising my grievance OR even worse, that I had been lying to get a bloody meal free. 
While I am aghast at this experience and utter disregard to a genuine grievance, I hope the idiots at SpiceJet customer relations and the airhostess enjoy a satisfactory meal at my moneys expense while I now head out to buy my child a toy bag which she missed because I was refused a service which I had paid for!!!!

Spicejet flight delayed,Kumarjit D,Guwahati - Kolkata (Calcutta),"We booked a flight from Guwahati to Kolkata which had scheduled departure time of 8:45 pm. It was saying ""On time"" when we reached the airport. But after we did completed security checking suddenly the flight departure time got changed to 11:15 pm. We didn't have clue how airline can reschedule the flight so late. We came to know it was because of the bad weather in Kolkata. However, Indigo flight which had the passengers already boarded could depart from Guwahati at 8:30 pm. We didn't have any option other than waiting till 11:15 pm. But around 10:15 pm, the flight got again rescheduled to 12:05 am. All the passengers had to wait in the airport for these much hours. Airline didn't take any responsibility to serve some food to the passengers untill 11:50 pm when all were starving and were getting ready to board the flight.
Very bad and cheap service from SpiceJet. I haven't faced this kind of situation any time before in any of my flights.

On board the flight, the team of Ms. Labhanshi, Priya,, Minni and Yeshley had just started serving refreshments. I was really not well and had suddenly started coughing incessantly .... it was not subsiding for a while. Ms. Labanshi was serving someone further up with her back to me. Hearing me coughing, she turned around and without even asking me, rushed with water for me. It helped me a lot. 
  
This gesture of hers, comes not just from training or from her upbringing. I thought it welled up from the deep, innermost and inherent goodness and kindness in her. More Labanshi's would make Spice Jet so much more fun to travel and more of her kind would make society and the world a much better place.

Was better when they started,Harveen K,Ahmedabad - Bengaluru,Used to be the most preferred airlines. But now there standards have came down. Starting from the hospitality to grooming they have compromised a lot.  Even the ground staff was rude. They treat their passengers as if they are doing a huge favour and passengers are doing nothing. I don't know how they call themselves number one. In flight crew was also not groomed properly. Even the long hair crew members didn't make the bun. If I compare it indigo airlines then there crew has still maintained there grooming standard. Grooming doesn't mean only doing make up it also means how your hair do and everything. My personal experience was never good with this airlines.

Dont take Spicejet onto / from an international airline route,Nilay_Says,Mumbai - Ahmedabad,"On my return leg from our visit to United kingdom on the 13th May 18 ( check this space for a detailed review) I had booked myself on spice jet for the Mumbai to Ahmedabad SG635 for our final leg. This however turned out to be my worst decision of the journey and thoroughly regret not having done my homework on the same. However, I am writing this so that no other international passenger suffers similarly if he does read my review. Typically all other domestic airlines have a seperate excess baggage policy for passengers connecting to / from international airlines within 24 hrs of the journey on their airlines. Goair and Indigo for eg charges INR100 per kg as international allowance for the same. Spicejet has no such policy. They charge normal rates of INR 285 per kg online to INR 300 per kg at counter. So do the math. Typical international allowance is 23 to 30 kg per ticket. Domestic in flight allowance is 15 kg. So in any case you need to buy additional baggage of 8 kg or 15 kg depending on your booking. It will cost you 2850 for 10 kg on Spicejet while other airlines you will get 30 kg for same price! I ended up paying over 10 grand for additional luggage on two tickets!  No wonder they have turned around due to such profiteering. Avoid Spicejet, if you are travelling onwards internationally as you will end up loosing part of your budget. Just to add , the flight SG635 was delayed by over an hour and the inflight quality of tables is shown below.

Spicejet seat charges!,Sandeep B,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bengaluru,"I took the SpiceJet flight from Kolkata to Bangalore today (6th May 2018). 
Firstly, the flight was scheduled for departure at 9 AM but it got preponed to 8.45AM. The reschedule happened when we were asleep (post midnight). We were in for a rude shock in the morning and had to rush things up to leave earlier. We had to change our plans to leave from home in a very short notice.
Secondly, when we had tried to web check -in, all window and aisle seats were shown as ""paid"". Since we were two of us, there was no way we could web check- in without paying extra. Essentially, this is a hidden fee and passengers are exploited to pay upfront or be in an uncertainty.
Thirdly, when we approached the airport check-in counter, we were told that only if we pay Rs.1000 extra per person, we could have 2 seats together. We decided against it and disappointedly went for separate seats. The seats assigned to us were more than 10 rows apart. 
Fourthly, after we had taken our respective seats in the aircraft and after boarding was complete, we found that a seat next to one of our seats was vacant. Good part is, we could sit together. Bad part is, we realized how we had been cheated. There were two seats available next to each other but we were not assigned. Ours was not the only case. The entire aircarft was full of such cases- couples and families separated because every seat except the middle seat is paid. Almost everyone was negotiating with someone else looking to swap seats. Such a pathetic customer experience. 
I don't have a problem with you charging extra, but if someone arrives at the check-in counter early enough when paid seats are unoccupied, assigning seats to members of a family separated by 10+ rows is extremely apathetic.",Domestic,2.0,May 2018,6 May 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

There was also a soft roll with butter (both of which I left, because it just didn’t go with the rest of the meal). For dessert, there was a brownie (so-so, somewhat dry and a little too sweet for me). There was also a tetrapak of juice, which I skipped.

Reminds of Bus Services of Mumbai,Some1stranger,Mumbai - Chennai (Madras),"Last Sunday took a late night flight from Mumbai to Chennai in SpiceJet. Well the harassment started from the checkin itself and continued till we deplaned. 

Since we had only cabin luggage, went to the self-checkin kiosk, which showed the message”no free seats left, please contact check-in counter”. So when we came to the counter we found that out of the 5 counters, only3 were for free passengers and 2 for paid checkin. The que for the free counters were too long and they were taking unnecessary long time for each checkin. Due to this delay, which, perhaps, was intentional, many passengers were forced to go to the paid counter. In a way they were almost forcing people to take a paid seat.

After the painful checkin process, the security check was pretty smooth. However after boarding the plane, the actual pain started. The seats were too cramped. Even the BEST have more leg space in their buses. The flight was delayed because of air traffic congestion and for the entire period AC was off. It only started after the flight was air borne. So one can easily understand the suffering of the passengers. The cabin crew were also reluctant to serve water an I was served water after 5 calls.

The flight reached Chennai well after the scheduled time. Really wouldn’t have liked to board again but alas had a return ticket as well.",Domestic,3.0,April 2018,26 April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worst Airline,Kannen A,Dubai - Kozhikode,"I have booked for a Spice Jet flight SG054 from Dubai to Kozhikode Flight  which was meant to fly from Dubai on 09 Nov 2017.

I got messages in my phone from 09 Nov 2017 from the morning that flight is delayed due to Operational Reasons.

The delay keeps on accumulating every hour and it becomes 11 Hours 35 Minutes.

I trusted you and went to the airport. I got the boarding pass and waited for the flight with 12 Hours Delay.

At the boarding time I got a message in the phone that the flight is cancelled.

The explanation is bad weather in Amritsar.

They  made us wait for 12 hours in the airport and there is no available senior airline staff to explain the situation.

I was wandering in the airport with no support from the airline what to do.

Finally I found a staff and he offered me a refund 7-10 working days or ticket two days later which he cannot promise.

They managed to get out all the passengers out from the airport which is very much inappropriate.

I am outside the airport now writing this E-mail took a flight in double fare which I am waiting again for 8 hours and missed 2 days of vacation out of 7 days.

If there is  an airline breakdown or bad weather in either the origin or destination I would have understood.

I understand that you do not care for your customers and show no respect.

You change your schedules based on your convenience.

This is the worst experience I had in my whole life with any Airlines.

If they had a problem you could have have informed us prior and cancelled the flight instead you made us to wait for 12 hours and then threw out of the airport.

You are operating an International Airline Service which your team is not capable of.

Please at least do not fly to Kozhikode and leave the space so that some other good companies can take over.",International,1.0,November 2017,24 April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Lacking Customer Centric Approach,Vishal_tulsi,Mumbai - Visakhapatnam,"I traveled with SpiceJet in the third weekend of April 2018 from Mumbai to Visakhapatnam. I booked SpiceJet after a really long time. I availed SpiceMax service for Rs. 1200/- for the first Row Window seat with very good Leg Room. Availing this service also gave me a complimentary meal.

I was carrying 1 Luggage bag weighing 18 kilograms (mere 3 kilograms beyond the free allowance). I was not carrying any hand luggage with me. In such a scenario, with my previous experiences, I did not think that SpiceJet would charge me extra. But, my expectations were shattered when the staff was reluctant to consider any request to adjust the hand baggage allowance with the un-utilized check-in baggage allowance.

The cabin crew was very polite and courteous. The Food served was warm and tasteful.",Domestic,5.0,April 2018,24 April 2018,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0
A good experience.,H C Sirohi,Mumbai - New Delhi,"I reported a bit early at the Airport, but my experience at the check in counter was good. I waited at the Airport, and the waiting was not that bad. The Airports Authority of India has done up the Indian Airports well and some of them are ranked 1st or 2nd at the world level. The Airline staff was very courteous and helpful. The check in, waiting and boarding were comfortable. I think SpiceJet has changed a lot. The in-flight food was also good, but the quantity was not enough for a dinner. The veg meal could have been increased by reducing the cost on packing. I feel it very bad on learning that some of the Airlines are wasting money on packing and reducing as also compromising with the quality or quantity of meals. The flight was slightly turbulent due to air. SpiceJet people do not have good reading material in the plane for passengers, which they should improve upon. Otherwise the plane was good, the flight was good and the crew members were also very courteous except the one who was heading them. He could improve his behaviour a bit more. The landing was soft and the taxing was also not very taxing. However, the baggage kept us waiting for very long. This time was unbearable, this could be reduced and the flight operators should think about it.

SpiceJet not to my taste,Philip B,New Delhi - Goa,We flew to Goa on 19 March using SpiceJet for the first time. They were not the cheapest flight that we could have used but we went with them after reading some good reviews. I tried to book us in using the online website checkin but whatever I did I could not get my booking details to show so we had to check in at the airport. We left in plenty of time to get to the airport and thankfully the long queue moved at a steady pace. When I booked the flight on line from Australia it said that there was a checkin luggage as part of the cost which was good but it was not overt on what the allowance was. As it turned out it was only 15kg so we had to pay for extra baggage allowance. This was the only concern for the person at the checkin desk who did not ask about the content of our bags at all. When it came to boarding the flight we were asked to step to one side as our bags did not clear security and had not been loaded. It turns out that we had some power packs for our phone chargers in our bag which were not allowed in the undercarriage but when I said we were not advised of this the very official and not polite or helpful girl stated that was not her concern and that the power packs needed to be off loaded. We were not given an opportunity to take them onboard as they were handed over to the security. We got on board to find that the seats were so tightly pushed together it was almost impossible to sit in them. The tray table could not be pulled down because there was no room. The plane was not cleaned prior to takeoff as there was dirt and stuff still in the pockets. I would not recommend this company to fly with.,Domestic,1.0,April 2018,22 April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Kept in aircraft with no airconditioning and with insufficient ventilation for 80 minutes,prabirdaswork,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Boarding for SG253 started around 6.00 pm. My wife and I boarded around 6.20 pm. There was no airconditioning and ventilation was insufficient even after boarding was complete. Many passengers complained but no action was taken. Many passengers asked for water but were not given water. 

One passenger used his mobile to complain to customer care. The senior cabin crew shouted at him and falsely accused him of threatening. There was no threatening at all. They wanted to deboard him and caused further delay but they were not putting on the air conditioner to address our complaint.

It was more than one hour by now in inhuman conditions. At 7.40 pm they finally put it on. Just after that they started refuelling. Did they not put it on earlier to save fuel and money? 

Another passenger wanted to put it on Facebook. Again they wanted to deboard him! It looks like the senior cabin crew is using anti terrorism rules to cause terror to the passengers. She should be punished. Spicejet should announce her punishment and apologize to the passengers they wanted to deboard publicly in the newspapers.

In future the crew should record on their mobiles the disputes between passenger and crew and action should only be taken on basis of recording and not false verbal accusations of the crew. If action is taken then the passenger should receive a copy of the recording.",Domestic,1.0,April 2018,20 April 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Web check-in was refused due to the fact, that we paid the ticket with a foreign credit card, we are Germans on vacation in India. Result was that we had to check in at the Airport.

Excellent Flight Attendants!,Souvik,Port Blair - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I flew with SpiceJet for the second time (on my return journey). The flight was on time and the in-flight service was going on as usual. I didn’t have much expectations on such a short flight. However, when the Kids special meal box was served, my kids noticed the Kit-Kat chocolates missing in both the bags. My son was a fan of it since he got it on the forward journey (CCU-IXZ) a few days earlier. I immediately brought it to the attention of the flight attendants (Sohini and Nandini). They apologized and went to look for it. After a few minutes they came back apologizing saying there has been a mistake by the packaging company, as the special package comes to them pre-packed and Kit-Kat chocolates should have been there. We accepted their apology and moved on. But we were pleasantly surprised when Nandini came back a few minutes later with 2 candies! My kids were very happy to get them. Nandini said that it’s from her personal bag to make up the missing ones. I was so moved by such a great customer service and attitude towards making things right. That’s what made my day!! I’ll be flying with you in future because of great flight attendants like them.

I travelled 12 times within India with Spice Jet.   For price they are hard to beat.  The experience however was poor and consistently so across all flights.   
The service they offered invariably had to go via another stop even on very short journeys which often meant hours waiting at airports for the next connection.

- Their complaint mailbox seems just a fake. The only response we got was an automatic response that our complaint was received, despite many requests for update
- Also- do not use flying for many of the routes, with short travel time and good communication. This is the place to protect the environment, as India is heavily polluted and you will get a major social/cultural benefit taking eg a train, meeting nice Indian people

i just had mailed to them about some query... that was not replied on time by them and then consequently another frustrating, horrifying, insulting instances kept adding on.

i had a terrible experience while trying to book pre board meal option... 
and when i got it on board, i cursed myself as why did i book it after checking the taste of it.... it was pathetic.
in fact, i also had booked two bags as well for our kids for Rs. 350 each which was supposed to be in 'airplane shaped bag'.
after seeing those bags, i laughed a loud as those were not at all 'airplane shaped bags' at all from any angle but just one small pouch of very inferior quality easily available on road side.

also the seat size was very small and not at all comfortable... 
seat covers were of inferior quality material, dark brown.... it was giving a feel of any state roadways buses.

also the most annoying things was that in spite of booking six tickets under 'friends & family' scheme.. i very categorically had asked at the counter to provide me with two window seats.... but to my surprise..upon reaching on the plane i found that in my row of the seats, window was not there... that section was blocked for any window.
i had small kids with me who wanted to enjoy the view through it ... but in spite of telling them, booking six tickets, getting the false assurance as well ..i did not get windows to view out..

"Hidden fees, and no disclosure",MandyRog33,Dehradun - New Delhi,"We had a very convenient trip booked with SpiceJet, leaving us about 4 hours to make an international connection in Delhi. A few weeks before we were due to go, we were told that our flight had been changed. This meant we now had just 2.25 hours to make our international connection, including picking up luggage, changing terminals, and checking in. We phoned and were told that if we wanted to change to an earlier flight, we would have to pay a fee (this new flight would have us waiting at Delhi airport for approximately 8 hours). Apparently SpiceJet will only allow changes free-of-charge when the flight is changed by 2 hours or more (1.75 hours was within this time limit). If I had elected to cancel our flight at this stage I would have received a reimbursement of approximately half the price of the tickets. So, I agreed to change the flights, and paid the fee for the change. I later decided to purchase flights on Jet Airways, as this flight arrived at a perfect time for our international connection. On contacting SpiceJet to cancel the flight, they now informed me that I would receive only about 10% reimbursement of the original value of the fare. This was a complete surprise as they had neglected to inform me of this new restriction at the time I had initially agreed to pay for the change to the flight. If I had been informed of this I would have cancelled the ticket at that time. This lack of disclosure is unethical business practice. Needless to say, we will not attempt to fly SpiceJet again.

I mean i don't understand of logic behind that what make deference between carry a luggage with 7 kg in aircraft. it's passengers choice. spice jet gave a free baggage allowance of 22 kg par parsons. so it's passenger choice whether they want to carry a. or else they wanted to give for chek in. what make deference i don't understand spice jet using a same aircraft for passengers and baggages. come on spice jet. i believe u guys have much inefficient to understand. second thing they cheating with costumers regarding the 1 kg charges as they mentioned that spice jet only charging a 80 rs par kg but the moment i got to know it was a 300 rs par kg. i was like what the hell. spice jet airlines manipulates to the travelers. they took from me 1500 rs for the excesses bag of 5 kg. but it was not excesses luggage why i charged because i was not caring a 7 kg of luggage my total weight of luggage it was 21 kg. but still they charged to me. we don't have any others options we have to pay because we can not miss the flight at last months. just because of manipulating information of spice jet airlines. i really very disappointing for this behaviours of airlines. if you guys refunds my 1500 rs chargers. so that'll be great. hospitality even the basic services don't exist for passengers.",Domestic,1.0,February 2018,20 February 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

DANGERS OF SPEMAX /CHEATING,16janardhan,Mumbai - Mangalore,"0N 6/2/18 Me and my wife had travelled from Mumbai to  Mangalore by spice jet flight at 0850 AM .I had paid Rs.1600 extra and booked Spice max. But I was to get priority check in. But that counter was full of ordinary flyers and I had to wait 20 minutes to get a  boarding pass. I had two bags and they checked the weight (20 KG) and put PRIORITY tag for both luggage.so priority check in is only cheating.
In flight my wife got hot meal but I got only cold sandwich.. Again cheating.
In Mangalore airport one bag came first with priority tag and the second bag came much later and priority tag was missing.On inspection I found my bag lock was cut and removed and was open .I had kept 5000 Rupess in an envope on the top of the luggage. it was found missing.
some body from Mumbai or Manglore air port employee-they have cut my bag and taken the packet in day time.So much security and checking. Even then in front of u people are stealing the things.So please donot pay for SPIEMAX .Travel.Travel as ordinary economy.I was again delayed at Mangalore airport to lodge a complaint
As per regulation valuables u cannot keep in checking baggage.
Funniest thing my total luggage weight was 20 kg at Mumbai airport. When the speicejet stafft Manglore checked the weight it was showing 22KG.
how is it possible.
This indicates airlines are over charging for less weight in Mangalore.

Requested me to upgrade to a better seat with free meals at a nominal charge, After second thought I agreed and paid. 
Then she instructed a ground staff to escort me fast through security (when there was a big  queue) and then to the boarding gate in time. Lucky me to get the first row with lots of leg room and a nice meal.

Even though the lady was doing her duty, it was a good gesture of her to put a staff along to ensure timely boarding. Couldn't thank her at that time.",Domestic,4.0,January 2018,31 January 2018,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Without doubt the worst company I’ve ever had dealings with,Nath4n,New Delhi - Goa,"We were booked to fly several SpiceJet flights in November 2017. One of these flights was a flight from Delhi to Goa. Shortly over a week before we were due to fly, SpiceJet notified us that the flight was cancelled due to a runway closure. Frustrating of course, but apparently out of their control, so we were initially understanding. What was in SpiceJet’s control however was the customer service experience that followed.

To summarise what has been a truly horrendous experience spanning 3 months:

• SpiceJet could offer no alternative flight that day, so I we had to book an alternative flight at 3 x the price.
• Due to the cancelled flight being the 2nd leg of a connecting flight SpiceJet calculated the refund of the cancelled leg on an unfair ‘km by km basis’ rather than the price paid for each leg, leaving us out of pocket due to the 2nd leg being much more expensive.
• SpiceJet erroneously refunded only 1 passenger of the 2 on the cancelled leg, leaving us an additional 7000 INR out of pocket. After querying this we were told the refunded amount was correct and that this was the end of the matter.
• It took 7 phone calls spanning 3-4 hours in total, over a period of 5 weeks to receive the refund for the 2nd passenger.
• Each of these phone calls was to a different agent and involved explaining the situation from the beginning each time and battling the front line denials and scripted replies in order to actually discuss the issue.
• We were assured on each of these phone calls that the refund had already been processed (it hadn’t) or that it would be processed (it wasn’t). Only after threatening a credit card chargeback and refusing to end a call to a manager before the refund was manually actioned was the owed money refunded to us, more than a month later.
• From the UK we spent over £50 on phone calls to India to get our own money refunded.
• In total due to a combination of administrative failures on SpiceJet’s behalf, we are out of pocket approximately 22,000 INR (£250 GBP).
• After escalating a formal complaint to the top of their complaint channels we received no apology or acknowledgement of failure and were offered a 2,000 INR SpiceJet travel voucher which we refused.

All in all, this has single-handedly been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered with any company, anywhere in the world.

SpiceJet may get you from A to B, but if you have to engage with their customer service departments via phone or email for any issues, prepare for a time consuming, fruitless and ultimately incredibly stressful experience.

For your own sanity, I highly recommend you avoid this company at all costs.",Domestic,1.0,November 2017,30 January 2018,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Watch out for hidden charges,Ema Datshi,New Delhi - Dharamsala,"I've flown SpiceJet a few times and they were very good but I stopped using them for a few years after their financial status looked a bit shaky and I switched to Indigo and Jet. For a booking to Dharamashala they were offering a better price than Air India so I decided to book.

Have your wits about you. If you don't read all the boxes and check everything, you may well find they are adding 'extras' that you don't want. I had to go back and start again to avoid 196 rupees of extras for some kind of 'assurance' that I suspected probably wouldn't apply to non Indian travellers.

I was also disgusted to discover right at the end of the booking process that there was a 1000 rupee extra charge for paying. Credit card, debit card, bank transfer - it seemed there was NO WAY to avoid that. This fee represented an extra 6% on the cost of the booking. Even Ryanair wouldn't be able to get away with tricks like that. They also try to get you to pay an extra 1000 (250 per person per flight) for a seat booking - you have to hunt around to work out how to remove that charge too.

Shabby front desk,drpkdas,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Silchar,Really the worst airline to travel with. Had an early morning flight and only 1 counter was open when I was checking in. It was the red carpet!!!!!! I was called and they wanted to weigh my cabin baggage. Well it was 9 kgs since I am a platinum traveller wit jet it wasn’t an issue but the counter fellow said it was 2 kg excess and I told him well it’s pretty cold outside and my winter wear is inside and he insisted I take them out which I did in a moment and wore them. He rudely said “this is a premium counter” not to be put down I told him you should have been manning the normal counters as I don’t see any body paying for your “sic” premium services and flashed my jet platinum and dinners card and to shut him up said I don’t use your airlines but am paying 8500 rs  for an hours flight as jet doesn’t have an early morning flight and I have some important work. The flight reached 3and half hour late due to bad weather and I had a joy ride for 3 hrs as they burnt fuel.... what goes around comes around.

SpiceJet should no longer exist on the market. Their service is unacceptable.,Codruta L,Goa - New Delhi,"Don't travel with Spicejet unless you want your vacation totally screwed up. This was the worse flight agency we had ever encountered with the lowest level of professionalism. We were supposed to fly from Goa to Delhi in order to get our connection flight to Belgrad (Serbia, Europe). Our time in Delhi should have been 3 hours which was considered more than enough to catch our next flight. After the boarding was over and all the passengers were already on the plane, Spicejet crew allowed a group o people standing on the plane stares to literally stop the plane from departing. No one announced us what was going on, even though we asked several questions and insisted that most of the passengers have other flight connections to catch in Delhi. At some point, a stewardess told us that the people from the stairs insisted that the plane has to wait for another two people to join the flight. No clarification was brought to us. It is still unclear if Spicejet sold more tickets than the available ones in the plain, or the group of Indian people making the scandal considered is their right to stop the plane until two more friends will join, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that the crew did nothing, but waited for 1,5 hours after the boarding was finished. The passengers asked them to call the police or the airport security but nothing happened for 1,5 hours. It was a huge chaos. At some point, many passengers, tourist mainly step out of the plane, arguing with the group of people who wanted to stop the plane for departing. No reaction again from the Spicejet crew. Due to this delay, many passengers from the plane lost our connection flights and had to pay a substantial amount of money to change our flight tickets.

The Mangalore airport runway closes daily from 00:30 to 4:30. Due to above mistakes of the Spice jet personal resulted in grave trouble to 200+ passengers, many families, children and infants.

To add to this trouble was the bullying attitude of the Spicejet staff, not taking any measure to ease the 6 hour stay in the crammed waiting area. One lone lady personal was only available. After shouting from the passengers some staff came, but didn't help much, just giving wrong reasons for delay.

This attendant was not so happy with me switching seats (God know why) and while she was telling me about moving back to designated seat she had her fingers pointed towards me (in our culture its impolite).

My experience of the SG 2640 from Udaipur to Delhi was abysmal, only helped by one Ground Staff, who had the wherewithal to be honest and communicate openly.  That was Mr Sarvesh - he himself made sure to give me a heads up when I asked him to give me directions on what to do.

Thankfully they did manage to get us onto a flight the next morning, which was again delayed by 2 hours because our pilot was delayed coming into Udaipur.

But the tale of woe didn’t end there. My luggage albeit marked FRAGILE in several places was mishandled and the handle on my new luggage was broken - the SpiceJet airport counter made me fill out a report right away and told me someone would get back in 48 hrs with a feedback.

If you like at my other reviews, this is my true and valid opinion as I generally tend to be very lenient.

We booked the flight online from the UK, but when arrived at the airport (straight from an international flight) we were informed at the check-in desk that the flight had actually been cancelled and we had not been rebooked at all.

But at the time of cancelling the flight they didn't even refund me. After a lot of arguing, and refusing to leave their customer services desk until we got onto the flight, we eventually got onto the plane. Their staff were incredibly rude and impersonal too. There was a group of French tourists on the same flight who told us that they'd been screwed over 2 days in a row by SpiceJet for exactly the same problem, and the same thing was about to happen to them for a third time which meant they would've missed a wedding.

goup booking,SunilPk,New Delhi - Udaipur,"we were making bulk booking online for travel dates 60 days hence. The portal played a dirty game with us. when we booked for 6 travellers, the ticket price jacked up by more than 1000/- per ticket. Later the tickets were available at lower price till the last day of travel. the portal has been so designed that the moment bulk booking of more than 4 passengers is made the price jacks up. If you make sall bookings of 2 or 3 at a time they remain low. Also the tickets should not be booked in continuation. AI jacks the price.

There should be gap of a day or two in subsequent bookings.

Two days earlier to journey they rescheduled it to 1610 hrs. And at 1400 hrs on 31 December, the date of journey, they further rescheduled it to 1830 hrs. And actually it left later than that!

Simply Awful,FisherKing157,Dubai - Mangalore,"I thought we had some bad airlines in America but SpiceJet is truly awful.  You really do get what you pay for on this one.

First, when we first arrive for check-in, with a NORMAL airline, you simply give them passports and within 3-5 minutes, you get boarding passes.  The reps usually smile and greet you.  They get trained to at least do that.

Not with SpiceJet.  There's a fellow looking at us with not a hint of friendliness, and seems bothered that he must be there.  I hand him the passports, and he looks at us and says, ""tickets please"" and puts down the passports, and stares at us.  We traveled a lot in our home country and internationally in past years and this is a first.  He then proceeded to ask us for the credit card that we used to book the tickets – also a first.

Then the flight was late by about 45 minutes.  It wasn’t well communicated what was happening.  We just looked at the clock and scratched our heads.

When we were finally boarding, they tried to pull me aside to charge me more money for the fact that I had a backpack, and then went to the duty-free shop to purchase some chocolates, which added another bag that they then weighed.

The guy just pointed to another queue without really explaining what was going on.  We figured it out they were going to try to extort more money. I handed the duty-free bag to my wife, which they didn’t bother checking in the first place.  Then they let me through.

This was the first and last SpiceJet experience. Never again for us.",International,2.0,December 2017,23 December 2017,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

OMG! Never fly Spice Jet if you can help it,Sameer,Bengaluru - Kozhikode,"Just arrived into Bengaluru airport this morning (16 Dec) taking the unearthly 5.30am IndiGo flight from Singapore. Starting off our  weeklong holiday, our family of three were all quite excited. Our 10 year old son who wakes up reluctantly for school every day at 6 am, was up at 3 am and ready to ‘hit the road’ to quote him in a jiffy.

Arriving at Bengaluru after 16 long years brought back nostalgic memories; and the new Airport was a pleasing sign of much progress that has happened here since we last visited. 

The SMS from SpiceJet early morning Singapore time telling us to check in 2 hours ahead of time (for a 1 hour flight to Kozhikode) was an ominous sign. Not one but two SMSes. We should have guessed! 

Our joy at djscovering that the domestic airport was just next to the international one was short lived when we saw the serpentine queues to check in. Weaving our way through a wall of holiday makers, we managed to check in to our Spice Jet Kozhikode flight. And the Tiffin Centre breakfast ‘Thali’ was divine (even though Singapore boasts an array of Indian restaurants, local Indian food has its own charm)

That’s where all the good things come to an end! I must admit Spice Jet really needs to get its act together. One of the worst experiences I’ve had with domestic flights. It seemed the company really believes it is kosher to delay a 1 hr flight by 4 hrs with a simple explanation ‘due to technical reasons’. Period. 

A lot of people had to make a lot of noise before the shift manager decided it was time to him to make an appearance. Fully 3 and half hours after the scheduled departure. 

Waiting passengers were served no refreshments, no effort made to establish if anyone had any urgent or serious needs or if alternative plans (the last flight to Kozhikode left at 1.20 pm) were called for. Finally it so turned out that people who made the most noise were given free meals (that too basic minimum). Amazing there isn’t any handbook to deal with delays which I am sure would be frequent enough. 

At the time of writing, we were still waiting for the departure; for four hours. Phew what a way to start a holiday.

Super first experience,bangalorebobbel,Bengaluru - Bulawayo,"Well, of course we didn't fly to Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, but to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. But you know: if you want to select Jaisalmer, that wonderful city in Rajasthan does not exist in the list of possible airports on Tripadvisor, and all my requests to add it to the list could anyhow not been resolved.
So, never mind: we took a SpiceJet from Bengaluru via Delhi to Jaisalmer. And some while later the same route back home.
Just to say it: it was great. After so many not so good comments I was quite sceptical, but we both (my wife and I myself in person) were totally satisfied. The service at the counter in Bengaluru was first class, our luggage got all the signs and flags to be directly delivered to Jaisalmer, so we had nothing to do with in in Delhi, later we went as first passengers straight in the plane, the flight was perfect, the food was somehow acceptable, definitely nothing to complain til Delhi. In Delhi Airport SpiceJets are parked on the fields, means one has to take the bus, and whiles boarding the next airplane there is no preboarding or so, but ok, that's not SpiceJet but Delhi Airport ...
The flight to Jaisalmer was fantastique. I love these small airplanes with two seats on every side, so cozy and funny, and that Bombardier thing goes up like a Porsche during start, and brakes like a Ferrari after landing. I simply love it. My wife is not sooo excited but ok, she has other priorities, such as safe flight and no worries with luggage etc. - and since this was also perfect, we were both very much satisfied.
After arrival we were among the first who got the luggage, went out from airport, job done ... really amazing.
The flight back was of same quality concerning service at the counter, service in the airplane etc., we were totally happy. Even though on that day our flights got for several hours delayed - it was one of those days with fog in Delhi and Varanasi and where not else, means not SpiceJet alone but all airlines were totally delayed. So we cannot blame SpiceJet but we were in contrary very happy how smooth the delay was handled - we got SMS and eMails about the delay, so we could stay longer in our hotel, the connecting flight from Delhi to Bangalore was automatically booked, we got even same seats as we had booked originally, so everything was totally perfect. Not a single detail we can remember what would have been not perfect.
Definitely a fine thing. Not only they are the only ones who offer a flight to Jaisalmer, no, they do it also perfect ... that is simply amazing!

They did not want to accept it, called management and left my friend and myself stranded there waiting for their good will. They then requested a letter from my bank confirming that my card had been cancelled. Which is not something banks are used to produce and was impossible to obtain before that flight!

In flight to the crews behaviour pattern and interaction seemed to just be a formality rather than willingly.

- Flight information by the captain
Very information with good amount of insights. Have heard very few captains provide this much of information.
Keep it up.

Lastly, the landing of the aircraft was way to hard and jittery. Once she touch ground, had to literally push against the seat in front due to the forward pressure.

Imagine receiving more than a dozen communication by sms, mail and voice call to coerce me to buy something! This may make good business sense but it was simply annoying to me. My contact details were shared with the airlines for important information, if any,  and not for unwanted sales talk. On top of all this the management at Madurai airport was deplorable. The boarding pass had no gate number printed, security staff could not help with gate number, there was no announcements that we could hear. The TV screens near all the gates simply displayed ""Welcome to Madurai"". We reached the gate and boarded the flight by following some passengers whose boarding passes resembled ours.

I reduced it in my hand baggage. When I got my bag she checked both my baggage and hand luggage and said your hand luggage is heavy please pay for that.

My review is based on the 6 spice jet flight I took in one month. From the moment I booked my ticket, I have been having so much difficulty. They sell you tickets with cheap fares and then have hidden feels for every step you take with the final fare coming much higher. 
    Their customer service is so bad and the flight is really difficult. Their cabin crew seemed to be so untrained and couldn’t find a single smiling face throughout the flight and mostly rude crews commanding passengers. Even their international flights do not even match any of the international flight standards and had so much trouble throughout the journey with this airlines so many times.

Just to clarify that I did not shift to a Emergency exit nor the 1st row with more leg space. It was in row I think 23 or 24. Any way this time my experience was quite good and as Spice jet does not open the inventory of seats even 24 hrs before except the centre seats I checked in at the Airport and fortunately the lady did give me an aisle seat.

Horrible an understatement,Abhinav B,New Delhi - Pune,"Writing about the sorely disappointing experience that my recent DEL-PNQ flight was - flew with them after quite some time, and was reminded just how much their standards and more importantly ethics have fallen.

1. In the days leading up to the flight, I recd SMSes every single day, multiple times a day, asking to upgrade to their SpiceMax seats. I would imagine it's understood that I would have bought a SpiceMax ticket in the first place if I saw value in it, but I don't (a full Rs 1000 extra, are you kidding me?!). Not only that, even at the check-in counter, the staff member kept trying to foist it off on me, recounting the benefits and urging me to upgrade (I felt at that moment as though I was in a KFC/Burger King counter, refusing the extra cheese / toppings they are hell bent on selling me)

2. While doing my web check-in, I was shocked to see that I have to pay extra for EVERY seat, save for some middle seats. Thus, despite checking in online in advance, I and my mother could NOT get seats together. Other low cost airlines at least assign seats together by default, and then charge should you want to change the seats allocated by them; but these guys do not even give a choice in the matter - you have us choose by force, and pay for it too! They hit a new low in my eyes with this cheapest of cheap tactics.

3. Lastly, I was reminded just how big a lie their boast of consistent On Time Performance is - everyone knows the DEL-PNQ sector takes about 1h55m in actuality, but other airlines go at most till about 2h5m factoring in taxiing time and a little bit of buffer; but they go a step further and claim a flying time of 2h20m! They get us to Pune a full 10-15mins late, and at the end still have the gall to say ""another before time arrival for SpiceJet""?? Do they really think they can get away with that?? Well they clearly have, considering their disgraceful airline is still flying on Indian skies; but boy, I sure hope and pray not for long...",Domestic,1.0,October 2017,9 October 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,N/A
Good airline with minor hiccups,NandanRao,Bengaluru - Amritsar,"We tried Spicejet for the first time. There is now a good competition in terms of low cost airlines and from a price perspective, Spicejet is competitive although not the most economical option. 

The check in and boarding process was smooth and the flights maintained the time schedules. The check in and on board staff are excellent and accommodating. The meals I booked were not available on board, however, the on board staff went extra mile to ensure that alternative arrangement was made for us. 

The seats are not very comfortable. In both the flights, the leather was worn out and I saw the staff just reusing the fallen headrest cloth than replacing them with new ones.

Overall a good airline, they need to sort out on

when i addressed this to cabin staff - she just ignored first then when i insisted that i am with baby and paid extra for this comfortable seat she told no place available and run away.

Avoid SpiceJet if you want your trip to be peaceful...,I am an Incredible Indian,Amritsar - Mumbai,"Wow! What a journey it was until we received a call from SpiceJet regarding reaching airport early as the flight was preponed... Ok accepted, we checked out from hotel and reached on time at airport. Oh! What we found that apart from their routine security check there was no multiple security checks as mentioned in their SMS received from SpiceJet. So our 1 to 2 hours were wasted. Then as usual flight flew on time and approximately at around 4:15pm they very proudly announced ""kindly fasten your seat belt as we are going to land BEFORE MENTIONED LANDING TIME"". Our flight landed at Mumbai Airport approximately at around 5:00pm and as the plane was finishing the rest formality, by the time my husband and me were seated and watching the loading - unloading of baggages from the another SpiceJet plane, and we saw that one baggage fell down from certain height and we looked at each other and I told my husband that I wish our baggage is safe...
We took our baggage from the belt and when I pressed the button of the handle and as soon as I grabbed it to scroll the bag, my hand got hurt and got one surprise from the SpiceJet 😊 which can be seen in the photos.
Then the same story they blame others for the same 🙌. We raised the complaint and received a call saying that it will not compensate.

I think I have traveled with SpiceJet three times and always they make passengers to run just to announce ""BEFORE MENTIONED LANDING TIME WE WILL BE LANDING""

I think now we all are that smart enough to choose our flights for our next trips because at least from now we have excluded SpiceJet from our list for future travel as reaching on time is more important for SpiceJet then the inconvenience faced by the travelers and the irresponsibility shown towards baggage handling.

Starting with the check-in counter i would say they were average nothing out the ordinary, they could have speed up the process if they wanted but silly chit-chats were more important when there is a huge line of customers waiting.

Entering the aircraft you could smell something weird like a stale smell and the cleaning staff didnt even bother  to take out the used tissues out of the pocket right in the front.

The service of the staff was really average as there were just 3 attendants for the entire aircraft which i believe was not enough for a passenger aircraft carrying approx 180 passengers.
The seats were uncomfortable and unfortunately my seat had a problem in reclining back so i was sitting upright, on requesting the staff present i got the most weird reply ever and i Quote "" Sir the remaining empty seats have been occupied by the other travellers to sleep on them""  to which my first question was "" DID THEY PAY FOR IT?"" 
Now i absolutely dont know what was the number 1 thing on their priority list ""WHETHER TO SOLVE A PROBLEM IN HAND OR DONT WANT TO WAKE UP ANYONE FROM THEIR SLEEP""  but it didnt happen and i had to sit through 4.5 hours of complete torture.

Did I mention that the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours which we got to know about after sitting in the aircraft so in total 6 hours of complete torture.

Got the extra legroom seats near the emergency exits upon requesting the ground staff when Boarding from Kolkata. Although, while coming back, the airport staff was a bit hesitant giving those seats but eventually gave those upon insisting.

More In-flight services (like Infotainment systems on each seat) should be promoted in this sector as this is more of a fun-trip kind of sector. Also, the In-flight Food & Beverage services should be priced similar to a local sector and they should not charge a premium just because one is travelling international.
For ex: A normal chicken sandwich costs about Rs.200, but the same was charged at Rs.260 just because the journey was to Thailand!

A below average experience with SpiceJet,Rishan Rafeek,Dubai - Kozhikode,"I am a frequent traveler in SpiceJet (once in 3 months). Last week when I flew with them from Dubai (boarding on this airline from Dubai for the first time), I had a terrible experience at the boarding gate. 

I carried 13 kgs in hand while the allowance is 7 kgs. I admit that I carried an extra of 6 kgs. I was asked to pay AED 60 per each kg. I paid AED 360 for the excess luggage I have carried. I did not object to them as I am expected to abide by their conditions. 

What happened next was so shameful. I passed the boarding gate and finally when I reached the aerobridge leading to the plane, I found a staff who informed me that the inflight luggage cabin is full and I was asked to handover my baggage and it shall be treated as a checked-in baggage. I was quite surprised and couldn't resist questioning why I was charged for the excess I have carried? My checked in baggage was much lesser than the allowance. The staff was helpless as he was unaware of the excess handcarriage charges those airline guys are making at the boarding gate.

Having said this, I would like the fellow passengers to realise that this is another cheap way of making money and exploiting the passengers. And I have decided that I shall not anymore fly with Spicejet nor shall I encourage my friends, family and known ones to fly with them as they do not reflect any kinda quality in any kinda service they provide to the passengers.",International,3.0,August 2017,29 August 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0

2. SpiceJet seats are two narrow for comfortable sitting, and the bulk head space is not adequate enough.

avoid flying spijet,drpkdas,New Delhi - Silchar,on my recent flight from Delhi to silchar via Kolkata I had a terrible experience. The flight from Delhi reached Kolkata early in the morning. at 12.30 I was supposed to board the flight to Silchar. in the departure lounge they announced a delay of one hour. after an hour of waiting they cancelled the flight giving no reason. since  no other flights were available we were all stranded. The officials some dressed in casual attire misbehaved with us and when the passengers protested and refused to leave the security hold they arranged an extra flight the next days. I being a very frequent flier knowing norms services down by DGCA got my accommodation in a hotel not to my liking. I cancelled their tickets and claimed a full refund which was later credited to my account. I asked for compensation as per DGCA noms and they feigned ignorance. I later took up the matter with their nodal officer and they agreed to compensate me with an amount equivalent to my tickets price. my question remains as to why were the other passengers not accommodated? why only compensation to me? they take advantage of the passengers and only those that can show them what's legal and consumer courts they relent. would you like to travel in this airlines which charges a huge cancellation fee but does not provide anything in return unless you take legal course I leave it to your judgement. even their nodal officers no are not displayed in a prominent place as per DGCA NOMRMS.,Domestic,2.0,N/A,28 August 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Not a great experience,RAVINDRAN RAMACHANDRAN,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"Flight No. SG 635, Date: 28 Aug 2017
First of all, Airlines are supposed to maintain safety standards of both the plane and the passengers. Spicejet seems to be oblivious of this. The flight attendants were least bothered about this. Many passengers were not wearing their seat belts and were walking around while taxing and even close to takeoff and landing. 

Flight attendants were in their own world. One of the passengers (who was of a south indian origin) was wearing jasmine flowers. The flight crew were making fun of her in front of all (that lady was not able to understand as the crew was talking in Hindi).
This is unacceptable behavior. 

Second, most of seats were broken. I was not able to pull up the seats during take off, when i informed the crew about this, they laughed and said ""no problem, you will not fall down"". 

If this is the way, flight crew is supposed to behave, then i will be reluctant to fly with Spicejet again.",Domestic,1.0,August 2017,28 August 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Horrendous and Greedy,Rahul M,Jammu City - New Delhi,"It was my second ever flight with SpiceJet and I had a similar experience I had experienced before when I travelled from Nepal to New Delhi. 

Booking experience is good but they will bombard you with upgrade and food booking emails and SMS. Check-in desks at airport also try to lure you into buying SpiceMax upgrade which I don't think makes sense considering they operate Bombardier planes on most routes.

Talking of boarding experience, staff has no info on when the boarding would start and boarding never commence on time mentioned on the boarding pass.

Coming to the in-flight experience, the staff is always rude, arrogant and carry that horrendous look on their face. They carry a flat face throughout the journey and the only time you see them smile is when you are ready to make in-flight food purchase. This makes me feel that they are in for your money only.

Their fleet is mostly Bombardier planes on short routes or Boeing 737's, cracking sound from speakers during announcements, enough leg room though and no mood lightning is what you can expect inside the plane.

All in all I suggest booking Indigo if you want to go for low cost carrier with better experience.

"Pathetic Airlines, Pathetic Support, Greedy, Rude Staff.",Sahil A,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,"We had a booking with them. To and Fro. The first leg was good and uneventful, however, the return from Kochi airport gave us a reality shock. So we were traveling with 2 cases, (2 passengers, 1 infant, fee paid). One case 26 KG, 2nd Case 13 KG. We went through with this luggage while going to kochi from delhi. While we were coming back, the luggage stats for the same were 27KG and 13 KG respectively, This Girl, Spicejet Ground Staff at Kochi Airport ""Mariya"" put us into the over weight luggage penalty zone. First, their staff calls us to buy spice max seats, meals, priority checkin, priority luggage etc. Once you do that, they will rip you off with such marketing gimmicks. We had a spice max ticket. This girl, Mariya, at the time of checkin, on being asked where is the queue to priority, sent us to normal checkin queue. While we were standing, we saw a couple of people moving to her at the counter she was sitting. I told her, we are a max customer with priority check in. She said, you are not. On checking our tickets, she saw we were Max customers. No Apologies, not even a single word. Rudely said, ""I am staff here"" I know who is a max customer or not. Pathetic attitude, arrogance. On revolting, she instead charged us for the extra luggage. Without any logic. So allowed luggage is 15 KG +7 kg per person. We had one suitcase with 27 KG and one case with 13 KG. We told her we do not want to checkin the small case and will take it in cabin since it was a cabin size bag. She point blank denied. Stating, you cannot take this to cabin. get two suitcases, divide 7 kg each and then take. What messed up logic is this? How can you accept a 27 KG bag of two people combined luggage and not cabin bag? Charged us for extra 4 kg's and rudely said, Do whatever you can do, I will see to it.
ON contacting spicejet support, they point blank declined and stated contact airport staff. Idiots don't know we have to board the plane. We cannot fight things out. There was no airport staff or manage to reach out to. No one is on time. On arrival at delhi, our priority tagged luggage came in the last when all people went off after collecting their's.

We were about to touch runway. Wheels were out however due to runway submerged with water, we just went like a V. Sharp uprise from the ground level, nothing like this we have witnessed in last 10 years of flight travels.

The first thing impressed me was while boarding was, that the Co-pilot was right behind me and he addressed me with a hello and smile which normally doesn't happen then onto the flight it was quite comfortable as i had taken the front row seat and made it more comfortable by the attitude of their hostesses Suhaira, Anjana and Oshin were more than friendly and helpful and also had quite good conversation with them as i had taken only one way they had also insisted i travel return only by spice which is a good feel though  unfortunately i could not but sure again i will definitely travel spice jet if this is the hospitality they offer.

My first worst experience,Rahul K,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),"This was my first flight with my wife and first flight with Spicejet. I didn't had much expectation from it as it was a direct flight to Kochi. I booked in advance( 40 days before). To and fro from Kochi were direct flights. 
But guess what-- they changed my flight from direct to connecting after 20 days without any good compensation and their reason was operational(Clap). They offered me only 7 days advance flight booking. How can someone change his all plan from Hotels to Office leaves in according to SpiceJet flight?
And my wife totally hates Take-offs and landings. Guess her condition- when you expected only one-take and one landing but instead you got two. That too within 3-4 hour interval. No ear buds or cotton balls were provided in flight.
Story didn't end here. There flights were late also. Instead of reaching Kochi around 12 pm we reached there around 3pm. I will be attaching picture of flight schedule to get you understand better. So our 3 hour flight became 9 hours of flight within India.

What amazed me that in morning flight we need only breakfast to cover the distance and time but when in connecting flight passenger will need lunch also. My question to spicejet is that- aren't you suppose to compensate me when I didn't choose connecting flight intentionally? Out of courtesy - at least - a meal?",Domestic,3.0,July 2016,27 June 2017,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

The AC was also not powerful enough to keep us cool and all the passengers were fiddling with the ac buttons. we were really sweating out in the flight. One time the pilot inform us that the flight was delayed due to technical difficulties which they did not have control on it but the actual facts was that the tire of the flight was being changed which took us so long to take off and we had to take all the trouble.

Highly understanding service by Spicejet Airport Manager at Bagdogra,Vijay K,Bagdogra - New Delhi,"I had to travel back from Gangtok to Delhi on 19th.  From 18th we have been receiving various calls about the burning situation, tourists not allowed to leave Sikkim to West Bengal (Bagdogra being the nearest airport). Our agency Alpfly refused to change the flight and left it to Spicejet to make any changes.  Call centre of Spicejet did not know the situation enroute from Gangtok to Bagdogra and asked us to get in touch with the agency who can only request to make changes. They even asked us, if others can come to airport, why not us.
On 19th morning at 7 a.m. we were asked to leave the resort immediately as there will be a convoy with police escort and we left. At the border of Sikkim there were agitations some stone throwing etc., and drivers of vehicles were scarred to go further.  About 2 hours of unrest, in the hot and humid climate.  It was almost 12.30. 
Then we again started contacting both Alpfly and Spicejet. No respite.
We started moving slowly and within half hour, we were stranded and stopped once again due to a truck burnt with the driver and ambulances and army convoys whizzing past.
It was then, we contacted the grievance cell and were provided airport manager's phone number. It was 13.30 then and our flight was to depart at 15.50. We were the physically and mentally harassed lot.
But we found a great humane person in the Spicejet airport manager, who informed that it would take about 3 hours of run from the place where we were and assured to put us on flight leaving at 17.25 hours, provided we reach by 16.25, otherwise he informed that he could postpone our flight to next day.  It all cost money.  I pleaded with him that I am a heart patient and would like to get back and also additional cost is of consideration as it was no fault of us.
Some how we could reach the airport by 16.10, thanks to our excellent driver and met him.
Considering that I am a senior citizen and also harrassed lot, he took us to his cabin, gave water and tried to convey our condition to his head quarters to get permission to allow us to travel without paying any extra charge. He showed not only a perfect understanding of the situation but went out of the way in helping us to travel in comfort.  All processes were over and we could board the flight like any normal passenger. Seats with sufficient leg room was also provided.

Open letter to Kiran Koteshwar CFO of Spicejet Airlines,AmitAdaitia,Goa - Pune,"Sir,

You have my name and you can check your database that I am a loyal customer of your Spicemax.

I boarded Goa to Pune on 31st May,flight - SG 517, Seat no. A1 and A.C. wasn't working. Crew kept promising that it will be on in few minutes which took almost 2 hours in boiling temperature.

Than promised that it will be on as soon as flight take off.

We all trusted your crew's words but it never worked and we landed at Pune all exhausted.

There were around 20 kids crying and few dozen senior citizons trying to survive and suffocating...... for the fresh air. Imagine 200 people sitting in a small room without any ventilation for almost 5 hours !!!

Flight Cancelled / Pathetic Service & Rude Staff Behavior,ushassutk,Goa - Pune,"a) Initially the flight scheduled to leave by 1400 hrs  was delayed to 1445hrs and thereafter got delayed to 1545, then 1845 and finally at 1900 hrs we were told that the flight got cancelled due to technical issues

b) We were then asked to either stay back or cancel the flight ticket however we opted to take the next flight as we were helpless as there was no other flight to Pune and the Spice Jet staffs were equally helpless with no clue what needs to be done and were not at all cooperative

c) We were then checked in to a hotel in Madgaon which was a very Lethargic hotel and we had no other option but to accept or leave it, while we had even asked for better hotel to stay in which was declined up front. The hotel staff were equally rude and we were being made to feel as if they were doing a favor on us. We were told that we had to have the Spice Jet Boufet food only which is being served with limited variety and anything over and above that would be charged. The food quality was Pathetic and I had to order separate food for my son and pay for it which is not at all justified.

d) There was no proper coordination between the staffs and no proper transport was provided to us - non AC cabs and an age old Bus to shuttle between hotel and airport. - we were hopelessly at the mercy of Spice Jet

e) As per DGCA guidelines I got my tickets refunded which was not the full amount paid. I also insisted that they pay for the food bill of Rs.2k as I was forced to have food in the airport lounge due to delayed / cancelled flights which again went deaf years. 

You can be assured Spice Jet would never ever listen to your woes as they consider their passengers to be treated the way they want.

His parents were having a tough time to contain him and as it was landing the parents remained in the seat. Just after landing the parent got up to take something for the kid from and the crew asked him to be seated. Yes, she was doing her duty but there was a debate and an unpleasant moment created.

I was given an offer to upgrade to SpiceMax for all four of us @ Rs. 1000 each, which means I had to pay Rs. 4,000 for 2 sectors. When I refused, I was offered 50% discount (note this point carefully) and I agreed for the same. Later on, I was told that it was only for Delhi Bangalore sector.  I asked them, in that case, where is 50% discount?  Still I agreed and paid Rs. 2,000/- for 4 of us to upgrade to SpiceMax from Delhi to Bangalore sector.  When I got the boarding passes, I noticed that they had quietly put free meal stickers only on 2 boarding passes and the remaining two boarding passes did not carry the sticker.  When I brought to their notice, I was told that was the offer.  I asked them to cancel the upgrade and asked for refund.  They cancelled the upgrade and told me that I would get back the amount in my credit card account within 5 days.  I fought with them for nearly one month and recently I received an email that money has been refunded to credit card account.  Whereas I am yet to received communication from credit card.

SPICE JET MY PREFERRED AIRLINES,GVS_Pillai,Chennai (Madras) - New Delhi,"I have been a frequent flier, well fly weekly and my favorite Seat is 1D especially in the ER Type planes where the right side you have long leg space. I really need the leg space. I am a Spice club member but its not active according to the COLD Priority Counter personnel who tell you off that the spice club has ended, so Spice Maxx is your way. There is not announcement while the advertisement is still there right at the back of the counter.
The air hostess are ok lot most of them, they are very attentive and are pleasant most of them, except one or 2 that has serious attitude problem. The overhead cabin(for your cabin luggage) for has sticker posted for Spice maxx customers to place your bags, so they respect your money(Extra Rs1000 for MAxx) not like INDIGO, where you pay extra but the overhead cabin in not booked for your seat. You tend to lose it to people who climb in before you.
So SPICE wins there a lot because this is a major issue and it resolve a lot of unnecessary arguments!
Online booking is convenient for Spice with good choice for Vegan and non, I normally go for cup noodles. 
Beverages all airlines still have the same drinks for past 2 years.
There is Bovonto or Thumbs up, Dare I dream of ""Root Beer"".......
Price range is good for in flight services for Spice. 
Indigo comes in 2nd. For Punctuality Spice has been consistent in ETD and ETA.
While Indigo lags behind. I rarely take Jet Airways because its costlier and none of the special choices of Spice or Indigo at affordable range.

Good Low Cost option to fly,Prabir G,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bengaluru,"I was flying to Bangalore on 23rd Jun'17 by Spicejet . The aircraft was a  Boeing 737 800 series.

The interior of the aircraft was Red which is the signature colour of the airline. Cabin was clean and comfy. There was good food option that can be bought in the flight, however, I was not hungry. The stewardess were smart , polite and helpful, though as a seasoned traveller I hardly need any help. Flight took off late at 5.40 pm due to late arrival of incoming aircraft , now a standard excuse of delays and arrived in Bengaluru at 8 pm.

Flight delayed by more than 3 hours without any explanation .

Poor leg space. 
No entertainment system in flight. 
At almost same cost, better facilities in Thai Airways.
Air conditioning not so comfortable. 
Stinking flight before take off. 
No air freshener. 
No intimation about delay. 
Seats highly uncomfortable as per standards of international flight.

Worst Service Experience,Chetan Chaudhary,Surat Thani - New Delhi,Not so good experience with SpiceJet. Many times I have purchased tickets on last minutes by paying more money.

Check-in Baggage problem - poorly handled baggage and nobody seems care of it.,Asia,1.0,June 2017,17 June 2017,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0
"Kolkata to Bangkok, 1-way red eye flight",Kat T,Kolkata (Calcutta) - Bangkok,"This is a true red eye flight. Takes off a bit before 1am (Kolkata) and lands around 4:30am (Bangkok, 1:30 ahead of all of India). So realistically the flight is only 2 hours ---- you may, like the reviewer, truly have slept through the whole airborne experience only to wake up to the bump of the wheels rolling the runway upon landing. 

Not much to recall about the in-flight experience. As for the check-in and deplane processes, those were fairly smooth. Getting baggage after landing fine too. You could complain a little about both airports (e.g. Kolkata is a little short of dining & beverage choices after 10pm; Bangkok-Suvarnabhumi immigration lines are little slow at 5am --- coiled line-up ran for over 30 minutes) but these things aren't exactly within the airline's control.

The high rating had much more to do with the flight prices and route offerings.
Not all low-cost carriers in India offer international flights. (Many of the international routes are more like for expat workers going west from India to the Gulf. There are fewer routes going east of India.) And for a cross-border flight which would cut out one's overnight hotel stay (short red-eye flights, which then require your attention to pass immigration and baggage and locate transportation into the city, are not for the faint-of-heart), the price was rather competitive. At about 5120 INR for the 1-way, it's more attractive than flying with legacy carriers whose 1-way offerings will usually charge you for the economy flexible rates. As remarked above, the red-eye timing here by Spicejet is fairly economical too -- if you can find the stamina to smile to immigration after 2 hours of sleep plus 30 minutes of waiting in a coiled lane, then afterwards waiting and taking the train into the city. (Food you don't have to worry about. Bangkok-Suvarnabhumi has 24 hours convenience stores, and if you can stave off hunger until you are in downtown Bangkok then you're in street food paradise.)",Southeast Asia,3.0,May 2017,17 June 2017,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

There were 2 air stewards on board apparently, however aside from take-off and off-boarding they were not present at all. We had atrocious turbulence throughout the journey which felt like the pilot had temporarily lost control. passengers were screaming and I was amongst the very distressed. There were no voice overs from the staff or pilot to explain what was going on, no explanation on landing either. When we landed, I was visibly shaken together with a number of other passengers. We explained to the air steward when we were getting off the plane what a terrifying flight it was and he rudely dismissed our feedback saying ""well we got here so what?"" - appalling journey - enough to put one off flying ever again.

Bad Service... Pathetic Flight,Namrata S,New Delhi - Goa,"We were going in a holiday to goa and unfortunately booked Spicejet from delhi to goa, flight SG171. The flight was ready to take off but unfortunately there wasn't any aircon available. The pilot makes an announcement that the air conditioning will be on when the flight will take off. On the runway due to congestion we had to wait for more than 30 minutes. Small kids and their mothers were going and requesting the staff that we are feeling suffocating and please do something but the crew members weren't hearing. People became really angry and said we will not let the flight take off if aircon isn't put on. On a holiday would you want to listen to such chaotic things. If these cheap airlines can't manage then they should stop the service. Atleast don't harass people. 

Our misery didn't end, we had to flew back from Goa to Delhi iin SG 172 on 14th June, today. We had paid for our meals and had priority booking too. Our seats were 1, 2D . When the air hostess approached us, my daughter asked for coke, she said that we won't be able to serve as all beverages are over, only hot tea is there. I said we paid and the thing is you justed started to serve then how come nothing is there, to which she replied that we don't get refill in Goa, we get stock only once when we take off from Delhi.

At SpiceJET check-in counter, it is not important when you reach the counter but it is when the agent finishes chatting on phone.  If you have to be lucky otherwise you will have to buy another ticket for another flight.  This is what they call great experience at SpiceJET check-in process.

We decided to fly(Hyderabad-Vizag < 60min flying time) due to old people back pain issues and ticketing staff do not care !!. Their motive is to sell another ticket at the expense of needy and handicapped customers.  Shame on your SpiceJET

experience,V Venkata R,Visakhapatnam - Hyderabad,"I am  frequent traveller of Spicejet 
earlier until I had a very bad experience 7 years back, 
when I lost my baggage worth Rs 70,000/-. You had sent me a cheque of Rs.1200/- which I had not  deposited. After which I stopped travelling by Spicejet.

Now when I had again begun to travel with Spicejet regularly, comes another jolt.
Day before yesterday I flew from Hyderabad to Vizag hassle free by Indigo with two hand luggages (without any check-in baggage).  Today when I took the Spicejet flight to Hyderabad from Visakhapatnam with the same baggage, while issuing a boarding pass Ms. Manasa said my hand baggage was in excess of 2kgs.
When I explained to her that I had travelled with the same luggage without any issue earlier, she called one Mr. Akhil. 

Mr. Akhil wanted to know what was in the bag, I showed him my camera and Mac Book. He was fine with it.
But after an hour later while boarding into the aircraft, Ms.Manasa stopped me and asked me to pay Rs. 1200/- for excess baggage. I was kept aside away from the queue and subjected to great embarrassment before rest of the passengers. Mr.Akhil too came there and demanded in a more harsh manner. 

This is not a matter of money, but the way your people behaved with a guest. If they had to collect the money, they should have done it while issuing the boarding pass.
So again I am forced to take a decision not to fly by Spicejet any more.

I hope you people change you attitude and become Guest-friendly

Good experience for a budget airline,S J,Kochi (Cochin) - Bengaluru,"Got an excellent deal while booking this ticket, I was not sure how reliable their service would be since I had to catch an international connection. Based on the research I did they seem to be a reliable airline. The flight was on time, check in was easy. They kept on sending me reminders to be at the airport at least 2 hours before departure, not sure if they would have done anything differently if I got there only an hour before. They didn't let me do web checkin since I had bought the ticket using an international credit card. I bought the fare with baggage check in option, the price difference was only minimal. This helped to make sure that my cabin baggage would be of the right size and weight, not that they checked either while checking in but budget airlines tend to be strict about it.",Domestic,5.0,May 2017,21 May 2017,4.0,4.0,N/A,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,N/A
Pathetic experience. Never again,Rashiv B,Dubai - New Delhi,"I had the worst 1st experience with spice jet, pathetic to say the least. To start with there was a long queue at check-in.We arrived 3 hours prior to our flight. I had to wait for 1.5 hours in the queue with my parents. My father is 64 years old. The girl at the counter from India don't remember her name was very rude and other girl who was from other country was still courteous.  We had 4 seats reserved in one row and when we entered our flight the people sitting and the back of our seat was already there and to my surprise they had kept the luggage above my seats as well. We had two hand luggage - one of them was an electronic item, called the flight attendent Mr. Sanjay told him that this area belongs to us and we have to keep our luggage to my surprise he told me sorry they already occupied it and I can't tell them to keep it any where else plus the attitude he was speaking with my mom was pathetic and rude.We had 4 seats reserved and the luggage area above our seats should be given to us it's also mentioned on one the luggage shelf the seat number. So the end of the story is Mr. Sanjay kept one of our luggage 15-20 seats ahead of us and other one which was a PS4. I had to carry it on my lap for 4 hours night journey from  Dubai to delhi. It moreover looked like a general bus in India rather than a plane.

This is a low cost carrier but offers a reasonable seat comfort with moderate leg space at the price.

Flight Attendants and pilots are non indians.  Cabin crew didn't care to assist passengers to keep bags in the overhead compartments. Their are also not humble, smiling and polite at some guests.
Ultimate thing was.... No AC, just warm breeze from vents. Some people approached cabin staffs. But reply was just 'OK'. I thought that I have to tolerate for two hours and write complaint at MAA (coz I cannot jump after the flight has moved from the gate). Then our goodness!!, AC was ON after take-off.

A Disgruntled Customer,Emraan Ellahie,Jammu City - Srinagar,"To whom it may concern,

I'm writing to you as a customer of your airline on numerous occasions, I was greatly offended and insulted by a staff member and so called leader of a spice jet team, Sangeeta was her name as I was checking in on my flight between Jammu and Srinagar. 

She was extremely rude, unhelpful and a terrible representative of your normally trusted company.

Sangeeta continued to be courteous and kept me waiting at your desk for an hour and a half, and was unwilling to provide customer service on any level.

If you honestly value customers and customer service I urge you to at least speak to your employee about her behavior.

I hope next time I fly with spice jet to experience the same level of quality I had enjoyed in the past apart from the last time I flew in the above mentioned situation.

Spicejet cares,Monika M,New Delhi - Bengaluru,"As soon as we settle down in the aircraft the air hostess brings water for all passengers.  This was a  pleasant surprise. Spicejet Cares for its passengers.

When I have requested for water in the other airlines which are not low cost, I am told we will be given water shortly.  Just before the aircraft is about to take off the air hostess runs to my seat to hand me over a bottle of water previously in other airlines.  This airline was nice to serve water to everyone before taking off.   You truly impress your passengers.

Another surprise came in. The Pilot announced that the temperature being kept in the aircraft is at 26 degrees.  He further announces if any passenger feels that they need to increase or decrease the temperature should just inform the crew. Never earlier have I heard this on any flight. This shows you care for us.

The air hostesses on the flights are smart and humble.  I must congratulate the training team at the airline for making this difference.

From Delhi -

#you changed gate number then what was printed on boarding pass
#your flight was not on time.. kept flyers guessing
#your ground staff just keeping gossiping amongst themselves with no update or info
#no priority queue for family with small kids or elder folks, just everyone kept in one single LONG line..this is not done
#you keep folks in bus waiting in mid of strip. make them wait inside airport then their hands tied to bus ceiling handlers.

From Guwahati - 

#flight was supposed to fly from gate on 1st floor. Boarding time was 3:20. At around 3:20 when anxiously with no info we asked few people one of your ground staff told that gate has changed to one on 1st floor. THERE WAS NO WIDER INFO Available on this..100s of folks just kept shocking...
#your flight never flies on time. supposed to fly at 3:50..was around 30 mts delayed. you claim 85% on-time. If this means 15% was one of our flights i agree with data else you know this is ll marketing gimmicks.. 
#again no priority queue..just everyone gets in one long zig-zag queue..

1. Checking & boarding went smooth.
2. All economy flight, so no warm welcome neither while boarding nor alighting (its a budget airlines). It looked that crew members were forced to stay on board.
3. Pre-start safety instruction, looked funny. Crew were not interested, they assumed that everybody knows.
4. Water was served in the cups, which had no shapes. I took an extra cup to hold it. Spicejet saves on cups (budget airlines).
5. It was quite cool temperature inside the flight and I was almost shivering, others may be. I requested for a blanket. My request was ignored. I was told that blanket is not provided in this flight. I had to stand near the tail to get some warmth. The crew asked to the captain if she can provide me the blanket. Later they reduced the temp. But blanket was NOT provided till we landed (budget airlines). 
6. No toiletries, even a basic soap was provided inside the toilets (budget airlines).
7. Inflight entertainment? what is that? (again budget airlines).
8. In short, it was an ordinary a/c. bus, flying in the air.
9. Seats were ok ok, the leg of my previous seat was broken.

For food, no comments, I did not eat.

SpiceMax a Scam,MathurGaurav,New Delhi - Bagdogra,"I booked a Spicejet flight (Delhi-Bagdogra) recently and received a call from Spicejet’s Sales person to upgrade to a SpiceMax seat. I was told that by doing so I will get, apart from other things, Unlimited Meals and Beverages on board, and there will be an Onground Staff at Bagdogra who will keep our luggage with him and we will just have to get in touch with him to collect our luggage at Bagdogra.

However, we didn't get Unlimited Meals and Beverage and even our previously pre-booked meals were denied to us, stating that we are now entitled to 'complimentary meals'. Also, there were no options available on board. Even the meal choices which were supposed to be on the particular date were not available on board. For one of the choices we were even told that it has just finished, even though we were sitting on the 3rd row and only 1 person ordered the particular option before us. When we tried to order a Beverage (after meals were over) we were told that we will have to pay for the same. Even the air hostess was very rude when we tried to ascertain the things and told her what the sales staff told us during the upgradation. .

Upon reaching Bagdogra, we were shocked to see that there was no Onground staff to assist us with luggage. We had to negotiate the crowd and pick up our luggage from the belt ourselves.

All in all, it seems that Spicejet fools people by promising something else and not delivering the same and get away with it because what can a passenger do once he is onboard.

You will be delayed or cancelled",Sabrina G,Kochi (Cochin) - Chennai (Madras),"Booked a return flight from Chennai to Kochi, on the return leg we were notified that our flight was delayed by 5 hours.  Called customer service and was told that we could be put on an additional earlier flight instead.  Arrived at the airport for said flight and was told it had now been cancelled.  Asked when the next flight was leaving and the manager on site, Vishnu P (he refused to provide me with his full surname) said he had no idea.  He gave us the following options: 

Wait for another flight - even though they had no idea when it would leave and if it would even be a feasible option.  We noticed on the board all flights for spice jet were cancelled. 

Book with Indigo and pay the full fare (this was based on a full refund of the spicejet flight)

As we needed to return to Chennai that evening we had to go and book the indigo flight.  Once we booked our flight with Indigo, Spice jet staff then told us they would only refund the return leg and not the whole journey.  The original spice jet return cost 8,424.00 INR the new Indigo flight (one way) cost 8,344.00.  Therefore we had to pay an extra 4,400 INR.

Argued with them at the airport and they would not do anything further for us, told us to email customer relations to complain. 

Emailed them yesterday, responded today saying that they would not offer us the difference back in the fare - even though they had cancelled the flights.  Offered us credit on the airline that we can use - only valid for 6 months.  Told them that I do not live in India neither do I plan to travel to India in 6 months.  Said 'sorry' then cut the phone.

I generally do not post my feedback but I had terrible experience with spicejet, I went on honey-moon on 20th Feb 2017. My flight was from Ahmedabad to Chennai and then connecting to port-blair after 2 hours of halt. On 16th Feb evening, I got message from spice jet that my connecting flight from Chennai is delayed and now it will be departing at 4:30 PM (I was suppose to reach port-blair at 1:30 PM) and now my halt at Chennai became 7 hours. When I asked customer care what option I do have, they simply dropped my call, I called again with angry tone and then they gave me two option either cancelled ticket and refund or wait at the Chennai airport! Both are worth less.

When I asked them to transfer to their supervisor, they just give me one email id custrelations@spicejet.com and told to drop mail and they will return within 24 hour and I did! My marriage was on 18th Morning and I was dropping mail to them on 16th. C'mon guys if customer is asking for help, at least reply within your ETA.

By my all surprise, they replied my email on 20th Feb (after my flight reached to port-blair and perhaps preparing for return trip) with one line explanation that passengers are already been departure in to flight.

We requested her number of times madam Nisha we had our bookings. We will loss our hotel bookings. I am a doctor i had commitments with my patient n work too. We requested number of times madam plz do favour for us. But she did not. Then she wasted our entire so that we can't do our check in. Then she said Mam I can give u next day 19 Feb flight but that to only one. After few mins she said Mam we can't give u tomm flights seat. I can give u 20 Feb flights seats. We requested her like anything else. But she didn't responded. Then we said Mam give us whatever possible. By meanwhile flight took off. Then she made us to wait for 2 hours t domestic mumbai airport. We had bookings at hotel at maldives for 18-19 Feb of about 25,000/ which was non-refundable. We had to extend our trip for further 2 days. So there was further hotel accommodation expenses of 2 extra days. N return flight to bhopal we had to cancel, so again flight rebooking expense. 
That day 18 Feb 2017 was a fest of year. There was psychological stress, airlines spoiled our mood, unnecessary expenses(although we paid In advance), time wastage(I am doctor), airlines disrespect for their passengers. Disheartening for us as we were travelling for our first trip after wedding.

Long Wait Time At The Airport,Georgio Valentino Rayala,Bangkok - Kolkata (Calcutta),We took this flight in December 2016 while coming from Bangkok to Kolkata and the journey was Ok without any issues but every time its the same issue [I took the same flight in Sep 2016] of long waiting time at the Bangkok airport before boarding and waiting in queue again for long time before getting onto the plane even though it was much better this time than the last time because they called inside the flight by their Seat number rows.Other than that the flight was good the price was very economical and they landed on time in kolkata.,Asia,2.0,December 2016,8 March 2017,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
An average flight compared to spicejet standards,Apratim M,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"This was a mid morning flight.Three incidents happened with me which I didn't like and hence I deducted two points:
1.The stairway was not aligned at the back.So I had to board the flight from the front which was quite an uncomfortable distance.
2.Due to some reason,mid flight there were obnoxious smells of pain relief spray and human excreta.
3.The attendant forgot to serve me a beverage that was part of my meal and she served it ten minutes before landing.
These two were positive points of the flight: 
1.The food ordered was good
2.The flight landed before its scheduled time.

Still tops the list of worst airlines in India,adil234in,New Delhi - Srinagar,"10yrs ago I flew spicejet first time and said to myself 'never again'. Ended up flying this yr again and same effect again, only worse. 
Don't know where to start...
At check-in the gentleman had a frown instead of a smile, he was more pre-occupied with what's going on around him than his own counter, forget a greeting Not even a hi, not even once did he make direct eye contact with the customer and if that's not rude enough, he garnished it up with his aggressive and tone and behaviour. Standing in front of him seemed like we where some petty criminals cought red-handed by police rather than an airline counter. When I wished him good morning he stared at us like I had just hurled an insult at him and didn't even bother to reply back. 
Anyhow, requested him to try to put me and my wife's seat together if possible and for the first time he spoke the only few words in the whole check-in process saying very sternly 'No, your seats are seperate. It's a busy flight' 
Boy was I glad to get away from the counter. 
Here is what surprised me More, the seat next to me was empty. 
Requested a hostess if I can get my wife to sit there and got same reply that the flight is full, didn't understand how was any1 getting on that seat now since the boarding had finished and captain had ordered for the doors to be closed.

Not customer friendly,DrMC,Bagdogra - Chennai (Madras),"Recently I had a bitter experience with SpiceJet Airlines. 
I with my two other colleague booked for our travel from Bagdogra to Chennai.
We thought we could break the travel by going from Bagdogra to Kolkata and from Kolkata to Chennai. So when we were booking, we booked one from Bagdogra to Kolkata. Then when we looked for booking from Kolkata to Chennai, we found the same flight after 30 minutes layover at Kolkata goes to Chennai. We thought that we could book the travel from Kolkata to Chennai in the same flight and may get boarding done at Bagdogra, combing the two tickets.
The travellers are same, the flight is same.
But the airlines refused two have combined boarding at Bagdogra. Since we have booked separately, we have two PNR numbers, we can not check in at Bagdogra by combining the two travels.
What the airlines say is that we need to checkout at Kolkata and get another Boarding pass then check in again for proceeding our travel to Chennai. But the flight will be there only for 30 minutes, but we should check in at least before 45 minutes of departure.
We explained the situation but in vain. We need to cancel our travel and rebook the entire travel which costed us about INR 18,000. 
We have also asked our booking agent for help, which we didn't get in time. In addition, the booking agent added additional cancellation processing charge for their part.

Horrible flight service,rashidhbti,Gorakhpur - Bengaluru,"Hi Guys,

I have travelled multiple times due to lack of option or last minute travel.Below is my review:

1.Flight quality is horrible.It will create lot of noise.You wont be able to listen anything for at least 2 days after your travel from a spicejet flight.

2.Leg space is very bad w.r.t other flight operators.

3.Chances of delay is more thats what I have seen.

4.Cancellations chances are also more.They will ask you to take money or reschedule it.Rescheduling they can do from other places also if tickets are not there.E.G, you booked ticket from gorakhpur and they cancelled the flight.They will tell you to come to Delhi and take other flight.They will neither give the cab/train charges nor compensate the money for flight as GKP flight is costlier than delhi flight.

5.Their customer care is pathetic.You just dial their number, you will come to know.It will connect after 30 minutes.And then they will move you from one option to other option.You will loose lot of money in calling that pathetic customer care.

6.Customer care people are rude.

Also, if a passenger pays additional 1000 bucks, he/she will get extra good treatment during the journey compared to other passengers in the same class. Ideally this differentiation should be on the basis of which class the passenger travels. The thing over here is, the passenger who hasn't paid those extra bucks sees extra treatment given to his/ her fellow passengers and has no idea about the extra bucks scheme.

The Spice Jet Max option is a great one to get additional services and extra leg room at a minimal cost and I highly recommend this. I am sure with time, they will extend this to cover more seats on the aircraft.

Nightmare!,Sasha R,New Delhi - Genoa,"I flew Delhi to Goa on 19 December 2016 and when my bag arrived it was open. I complained to SpiceJet ground staff and they took a photograph of the bag as it had arrived, clearly showing it had been opened in transit. They then asked me to check contents to see if anything was missing. I did so and there were a number of items missing. I asked for a written report and they flatly refused to give me one! I argued with them but they told me they could only provide a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) for missing bags!! They asked me to write a list of the missing items on a piece of paper, that they took from me advising that they would check with Delhi and call me. Luckily my companion took a photo of the list before we left the airport else I would have no evidence of this at all because I heard nothing more from them.

Returning to Delhi on 30 December - with a different airline - I went to the airport 2 hrs early so I could visit Spice Jet office and demand a PIR. I was told the manager was in a meeting - and he stayed in it for nearly 3 hrs before I eventually had to leave! I did at least manage to get the two SpiceJet staff members to come to us when I insisted they provided the photo of my opened bag, which I copied to my phone.

The way I was treated was unbelievable, until I was shouting in frustration trying to get them to simply provide a PIR! They continued to refuse. With hindsight I realise I should have reported this to the Goa police on 19 December so that at least I'd have a report for my insurance company - who are refusing to recompense me without a PIR! They do not accept that an airline would not have provided this if I had reported a loss to them!

Meanwhile, I have exchanged countless emails with SpiceJet Customer Service/Nodal - and written to SpiceJet owner Ajay Singh - who keep telling me they are investigating this matter.

Coincidentally, whilst writing this, a few minutes ago I received a phone call from SpiceJet in India telling me they want 2 more days to investigate.

Surprisingly impressive,Bharat Agarwalla,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Recently I undertook a flight from Delhi to Kolkata on the 21st of January 2017 on SG 253.
I want you to first note that since 2012, I had not taken any flight on Spicejet as my impression about the airline had been relatively poor. I did take a flight last year in May/June from Kolkata-Chennai and back but the experience was very average. Lately I had been reading a lot about the on-time performance of Spicejet and also good reviews from friends so I decided to experiment by taking this above mentioned flight.
Starting with the check-in which was extremely smooth. I had topped up my ticket with Spice Max and the line was relatively empty and my turn came in quite fast. The lady at the counter was quick and efficient. I was impressed at that. She also guided me where the door would be and I was there at the Gate and here I was greeted warmly by one of your staff. It was cold and breezy outside so I requested that I could stand just a feet inside the gate till the bus arrives and she obliged. The other passengers did go outside and were waiting for the bus. When the bus arrived she politely asked me to proceed. The bus ride to the aircraft was also smooth. I went to the flight and then seated myself on my Emergency Reclining Aisle seat. Soon the airhostess came and briefed us of the procedure and the flight then took off. Extremely smooth take off as well. Later the food service commenced and all the 4 onboard crew were smartly dressed (I least expected them to be smart looking in fact but they were young and quick and polite and efficient). The food service was good and quick. I do not remember the names of all 4 of them but I do recall one was Misba, another was Alpana and one I think was Sandeep but not sure and last one was Evlyn (spell check). The landing also was very smooth once again. The flight took off 10 minutes late but landed 5 minutes early. This was once again true to the spirit of ontime impression that I had been given lately. Seated next to me was Ms Oindrila Das. I happened to speak to her and she was going to be joining the fleet as an Onboard crew she said. She had just finished her training and was on her way back home (Kolkata) before she is posted in Hyderabad. The chat with her further made me impressed that the company is hiring efficient and polite crew. I am sure that the company will go a long way if they keep this spirit up and hire efficient staff on ground, and on board the way they have been doing.

Only one thing is of concern to me. I originally had a SpiceJet account since 2010 and later in April 2016 I created a Spice Club account. Both accounts have the same email id and the same mobile number. But sadly now when I am trying to merge both together I am unable to do so. The SpiceJet account is showing separate and when I try to Upgrade the SpiceClub account then it shows I am already registered with the same mobile number. I am sure that a lot of other users must be facing the same issue and SpiceJet should make provision for smooth merging of both by a simple command or click.",Domestic,5.0,January 2017,24 January 2017,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Whilst I called the call centre as soon as we realised that we had left our wallet back in the flight and the representative could not do much which is where I feel all airlines can improve.  All of them need to have all communication channels open.  What really bowled me over is that I got a call from the airline airport staff proactively and they informed me about the wallet.

This is a low-cost airline that has managed to become the fourth largest airline in India by the number of passengers carried. The planes were good, at check in the staff member tried to sell me an upgrade, but the trip was too short to benefit from that and the upgrade itself was not worth it.
 
The airline has a 15kg baggage allowance, so I left most of my luggage in Mumbai and only took what I needed which was well under the limit. What was interesting that nearly every person in front of me checking in had to pay an overweight fee - a good way for the airline to push up its profits.

There was chaos and finally we learnt that we were to report to the ticketing office for further information..
  There a set of incompetent staff just could not handle the situation. After almost two hours we were told to go to a Hotel called the Airport Nest. The horrible experience in that hotel shows the standard that Spice Jet keeps.

    No such help was shown. On the contrary, the Spicejet staff could not find our boarding pass. They had misplaced it.
Finally we were directed to the Jet Airlines counter to pick up our fresh boarding pass from Jet Airlines.

During checkin I requested for wheel chair assistance which the travel desk of Spice Jet promised. At first they said that wheel chair was not available. After some time the wheel chair arrived but now the poster who was to take the wheel chair was not available. When I talked to the Travel help, I was told to wait for some time. However, even after waiting for fifteen to twenty minutes when there was no response and the travel desk seemed to be non committal wrt the time frame, she was forced to walk.",Domestic,3.0,December 2016,4 December 2016,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

Ticketing policy of Airlines,iamnoone2016,Kochi (Cochin) - Chennai (Madras),"I had to make an urgent trip and made the ticket booking online around 5 pm the day before the flying day and was shocked at the fare of around Rs. 4000, for the onward journey and almost 3 times of about for the return flight on the same day. Due to the fact I had to make the trip, and convenient flight times 
of this particular Airline, l purchased the ticket.

However, on my way to the Airport I got the message of flight delay of over 2 hours. And on reaching the Airport counter I was told about further delay, however they were kind enough to offer full refund as the delay was over two hours and I was lucky to get a flight on AI, which incidentally was on time .

However my point is, when checking online at the Airport I was shocked to note the return fare has come down to the same as the onward journey! 

Whatever the policy being followed by the Airlines, i felt cheated and unfair to the traveller. I had paid around Rs.15,000/- where as I should have been charged only about Rs. 8,000/-

The Airlines and the Authorities should take serious view of the present ticket pricing policy of Airlines and maximum ticket price ceiling should be regulated and not allow Airlines to charge unreasonable and exorbitant price for a ticket.

To top it all, my return flight was also delayed and had to take an earlier flight, which the Airline allowed, thank God for small mercy's.",Domestic,1.0,December 2016,3 December 2016,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

India's Worst Domestic Airline - What a poor attitude!!!,Subrata,Amritsar - Mumbai,"I had recently flown with them from Amritsar to Mumbai, as they are the only airline providing a direct connection. That's it. That is the only good thing. Rest all are bad.
Firstly the cabin was dirty.
Secondly the food they sell was not as per the preference. 
Thirdly crew members were looking like unhappy souls, no smile on their lips. (are not they getting their salary in time?)
Fourth, the extremely poor attitude. Seats near emergency exit were priced at Rs.1000 higher for having more leg space. Even though they are non-reclining. Even the hand rest was missing at the window side.
One tall fellow passenger who was finding it just to difficult to keep his legs within the available space, requested the air hostess if the vacant seat near the emergency exit can be given to him. He was refused saying those are premium seats and extra money has to be paid. First they cannot provide adequate leg space and then Rs.1000 was more important for them than helping a customer. With such poor attitude they cannot survive long. they are far behind the Jet Airways service levels and standards.

FLYING CITY BUS,perfectreview123,Mumbai - Goa,"Journey though short but was really uncomfortable. I feel that all flights know the exact ATR timings for all flights to take off and hence should adjust the Flight Boarding timings. We were boarded in flight and kept awaiting for at least 40-45 mins in the flight before take off. That was really uncomfortable as the Air-conditioning inside the plane was not 100% and that caused a suffocating feeling.

Further the seats and the space between two rows is disgusting. Having paid this high amount to travel we had a feeling of local city Bus travelling in the flight.

In fact having paid similar or lesser amount to my other destinations with JET and INDIGO Airways the Journey was more comfortable and especially seats and spacing between two rows were really comfortable and also to mention the Air-conditioning.

In future SPICE JET will be my last choice and that too in case of any emergency. There were few others too who found themselves uncomfortable and they may not write to you but surely they will not opt for SPICE JET anymore.

We tried explaining it politely to the staff at the counter and then the manager Mahesh that it was only due to the high alert (we were flying when high alert was sounded across the Nation at major airports) that we had checked everything in and since we were not even carrying any hand bag; this small waiver may please be considered. However; the customer service skills had gone for a toss when we heard blunt and blatant NO and moreso; we were given the routine and mundane excuses of how the staff would have to bear the ""LOSS!!!"" if we refused to pay!!! We surely got upset with the behavior of the staff that was appalling and accepted to make the payments. Meanwhile; the check in counter staff had already asked us our seat preference and we happily requested him to give us a window and an aisle with the middle seat vacant if that was not asking for too much. Remember, we put in a preference as we were asked by the staff. Now, when it came to paying; the staff again asks us to move out and go and make the payments at the ticketing counter!! So, when I am gone to make the payments under protest; the staff is yet again rude and has the audacity to ask my wife to move out of the queue in order to make way for the other passengers who were ""waiting??!!"". And he goes on to mention that he would not release the boarding cards unless he sees the receipt for the INR 300 odd that I had gone to pay already and that he could see me doing so just across at their own ticketing counter. Now, does the airline think I would have run away without paying INR 300 when I have entrusted you with all my valuable luggage??!!! Pathetic! Now, after the check in and security and after the boarding was complete; we noticed after take off that at least three rows (18 seats) behind us were all absolutely vacant and in our row; the third seat was occupied by another passenger!! Here, please refer to my previous statement of how we were asked for a seat preference at the check in. Now, my question is why ask if you have already decided to punish the passenger just because you have an altercation with the passenger at the counter?! Upon arrival at Delhi; we had to wait for almost half an hour for our bags and this, I am assuming was because of our fault of checking in first!!! Overall, a pathetic experience of flying with Spicejet and never in my life am I going to fly with this airline again. Being a customer service professional myself and having conducted various mystery audits and soft skills training sessions for brands across the board; this essentially has stood out as one of the worst ever memories and is an indication of orientation towards making money at the cost of losing valued customers.
Furthermore; when we wrote to their customer service and even escalated the issue to their nodal officer; all we received were typical computer/robot - like responses and zero levels of understanding. The personal touch that should be existent was completely missing and till date we do not know if those who mailed us back were humans or computers as we did not even receive ONE phone call personalizing and empathizing with the entire issue.",Domestic,1.0,October 2016,31 October 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Incredible deception!,Halisayed,Dharamsala - New Delhi,"27 Sept I missed my flight No 2192. At the airport I asked the spice jet  staff to find me a place on the next flight as I had to catch my international flight. They apologized as the flight I wanted to take is fully booked. They proposed that I wait till last moment may be someone would cancel or doesn't show. I waited around 2 hours and the concerned employee came with the good news: they found a seat for me. He accompanied me to another office to pay. I got the chock of my life as the price was almost 4 times the price I paid for my missed flight!. I had to pay 12530 rupees! I was told that prices went up last month and that I was luck to pay this amount!. 
At the check in they charged me 7100 rupees extra weight! They didn't even consider any discount as I didn't have any handbag which  passengers are allowed to carry!
I was on the plane and we took off. I went to wash my hand and I got the chock of my life: 15 seats were vacant! But to make more money they lied and they gave me a seat with extra legroom despite the fact that my original ticket was on economy! 
I was furious and when I arrived home I wrote a complaint  but I got no action taken regarding the deception and dishonesty of staff! 
I will never ever use spice jet again!

Most pathetic airlines ever,Shashank,Dehradun - Varanasi,"Dear All,
SpiceJet is most pathetic airlines you will travel with. Firstly they charge you Rs. 20000 for booking a connecting flight ticket 3 months before and then reschedule one flight such that you need to go into time machine to travel to your destination. When asked upon, their customer service executive says, we can't do anything in this and then forcefully reschedules the ticket without even taking the passengers consent. When you drop a email to them, they only ask for apologies and nothing else. 
I booked a flight from Dehradun to Varanasi via Delhi for 22nd Oct'16 in month of July'16. Dehradun to Delhi flight was supposed to depart at 12.40 and reach Delhi by 13.55 and then Delhi to Varanasi flight was suppose to depart at 18.15. These people preponed the Delhi to Varanasi flight by 6 hours and 15 mintues and it departed at 12.00. How can any one board this flight. On top of that airline was not ready to help at all. They were only giving lame excuses.

3) The food they provide will me more horrible.

I would say its more pathetic than tamilnadu local town bus. Infact tamilnadu local town buses are way better than spicejet. Never ever book your journey in spicejet. You will be end up hating the whole airline services if you do so.

Subjected to undignified experience,anil1981,Chennai (Madras) - Kochi (Cochin),"Here is the story. 

I booked 2 tickets for my relatives through Spicejet website from Chennai to Kochi(16Oct 10AM flight SG 3263). They are 2 middle aged women, one of them who is mentally challenged. I booked a seat close to the door, for their convenience paying Rs.200 extra. I got a call from Spicejet customer care, that as part of promotion, they are willing to upgrade the seat to ""premium class""(front row) with Rs.300 more which otherwise would cost Rs.1800 extra. I fell for it and upgraded the ticket. Everything went smooth until the passengers boarded the flight and occupied the front row seats.

Soon after the airline personnel asked them to move to a seat further down 4 rows. Reason cited was that it was a mistake to allot these seats as they are ""emergency seats"", and they would not allow online booking of these seats again. After some arguments, my relatives had to occupy the seats pointed to them. Soon after, they could see some big shot honcho occupying the front row emergency seats from which our humble travelers were re-seated from.

Why does the SpiceJet airline allow its loyal passengers be subjected to this kind of humiliation. If it really was so much about emergency, why don't they allow the VIP to board the plane in ordinary seat(""cattle class"") instead. This is a prime example of VIP culture in India where the ordinary citizens suffer. Anyone in the airlines listening? Its not about the refund or the amount of inconvenience. Its about dignity.

I said no and walked away but they followed me and asked me to come back but pay.

 I said No, I wasn't going to pay that much. In the end they put me on the flight (only passenger in the terminal, the rest were on the plane. 

They took me and a staff member of a bus (for the two of us) across the tarmac to the plane after I paid I think 300 or 400Rs. I felt the way India does ticket sales a then swamps you with extra for 'overweight' when their limit is 5 or more kg under the international limit is a joke. Most foreigners carry far more baggage than domestic passengers but they also allow people to carry on board what would clearly not fit the the western 7kg bag size and shape... It is a joke and clearly simply revenue gathering.  So be aware of it and pack accordingly if you are in India on domestic travel.

Excellent when on Time,Rajesh A,Dubai - Pune,"A no frills airline, very convenient. The Timings that they have managed from Dubai - Pune and return are excellent, giving a person time to finish his day in either place and depart.

Spice Max is the obvious choice, more leg room, hot meals and seats upfront. Smiling staff, quite helpful.. The best is when they are ontime and in a few cases recently have been landed before time, which on a regular basis is commendable.

The downside if the departure time from Dubai.. 11.30.. Any delay messes you up as you reach at 5 AM and on a working day can be a disaster. Similarly when they are late from Pune, they can be horrendously late.. On the total trips so far, the hit rate of OTD has been 80%, which is extremely good.. 

Only tip: The seats are not comfy enough or cushioned enough.. So sitting for three hours can be a pain in the butt ofcourse... :)",International,3.0,September 2016,2 October 2016,4.0,2.0,N/A,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

The email as follows:

I want to tell you a story about my worst flight experience

On the 28th Augost I missed my flight from Delhi to Port Blair,

Missing  the Flight was myown fault .

However it has apeared that since then you would not do ENYTHING to halp your costumers:

First we had to buy the full ticket again, even though we missed only the First section from Delhi to Kolkata. Athough  went on the same flight from Kolkata to Port Blair as our first order, what led ,if you are still following, to the absurd fact that we bought tickets to a flight which we already had sits on, (Who needs logic) 

I wish it would end by that. 

but you had your plans, so we bought the new tickets but something weird happened; your representative in Delhi's airport said she does have two tickets for us for the next flight however for different prices (one was about 22000 Rupees and the other one was about 23000 Rupees) we figured there will be at list a difference for the more expensive ticket, maybe a meal or maybe just a good seat. As you can guess we were refuted. 

So far it's OK if you love money so much who are we to stop you from getting it, after all we were just two stressed and afraid costumers who wish to get to their destination, who wouldn't take advantage of those two.

At  this point a dim light at the bottom of my empty pocket appeared:

Your representative told us to make a phone call to the number on the wall behind her and ask for a tax refund for our missed flight. 

Here I will skip ahead a little bit, we landed at Port Blair and were about to start our vacation in Andaman Islands. We tried to call however a surprise reviled a voice mail answered us saying: ""This number doesn't exist"", we tried the two numbers on the flight ticket but again ""This number doesn't exist"" we tried from another phone and one day after, still no answer.

A big airways company and there is no way to contact!

After a little bit more than a week we called and got the long awaited answer,

We asked for the refund and yet another obstacle was raised,

the refund goes to the agency we bought the tickets from, a small agency office in Manali got our refund, ""Can't I give you my bank account details and you will send it to me"" I asked your representative, ""No"" was the answer ""you look for their number on line and call them"".

I went on an errend on the internet to find the small agency we bought the tickets from but as I said before ""small agency""

So I don't know if I will ever see my money again, but you can be surely certain of one thing: I will never fly again with Spicejet and I will tell this story to anyone who think about flying with you and post whereever i can because as i said before it is my responsibility

I was not at all impressed for the price that I paid for this airline. The staff seems to always be in a hurry to make announcements. The announcements seems to not have evolved over time and is quiet boring per say rather than grabbing the passengers attention. They boast about the new menu on board which I feel has been prepared without a lot of thought into it. They serve biryani on board and the packaging makes it even more of a messy affair to eat. The food on board is quiet expensive as compared to the other competing airlines.

It was a pleasant experience while going to Port Blair. While returning, the flight was rescheduled. It was rescheduled for the next day. We got the information just an hour before the flight. Lucky, we did not vacate the hotel by then. So, we extended. When I called their customer service, they were very rude when I questioned about the schedule and why is this a last minute information. When inquired about the stay options or arranging a ticket in another flight, the rep said ""either you travel the next day or you can cancel the ticket and take a refund for the money paid"". I booked the tickets well ahead for cheaper rates and the current rate on that particular day was triple the rate that I booked in any airlines. This really irritated me. I spent another 4000 INR to stay there for a day to catch the flight the next day.

While entering the Port Blair airport, the security personnel did not agree to look into the mobile and they definitely needed a printout. Without any options and without any internet or computer centers nearby, we went to the spicejet counters asking if they could print the tickets for us. They charged 100 INR for each ticket.

This time, flew the BOM-ATQ-BOM (I think SG is the only airline that does a direct flight to Amritsar from Mumbai) sector and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with how the airline seems to have made a turn for the better. Service on ground was fine, the lady at the counter in both BOM & ATQ did greet us with a smile. Since we were a family of 5, we opted for the web check in, which charges a fee but I'd say it's worth it, especially if you want to be seated together.  The flight attendants did their jobs very well, with a smile. I really like their casual weekend uniforms, they give such a lovely pop of colour. The menu seemed pretty vast, although it stated that you'd need to pre-book certain meals if you wish to partake of them. Aircraft out of BOM (names Sumac) was a newer B737-800, very clean and well maintained. Aircraft on the way back (named Nigella) was an aging 737-800, however it was fairly ok in terms on cleanliness.

They have just basics in place with no lessons on service of customers or handling their queries. The in flight service was sad as the staff did NOTHING AT ALL to help any passenger except sell F&B...they would not resolve any queries or arguments that passengers were getting into between themselves.

The push back buttons were broken for the entire row and had gone inside the arm. On asking the cabin crew for change of seats, I was asked to pay for the extra leg room space seats, The crew wasn't courteous enough to have me seated on the other seat and chose to keep the seat empty.

There was no one in the departure lounge from the Airline to keep the passengers informed of the delays. I will not fly on this airline again.
Pathetic and simply terrible. The staff in the flight was simply rude. No manners at all. Being a frequent flier I would never EVER recommend this airline simply because of their staff and callousness. This kind of service will lead Spicejet no where. Management needs to figure out how to make their planes fly on time.
Traveled 3 time with spice jet and had the worst travelling by air experience. Boarded a flight from Hyderabad on 14/08/2016 to Ahmedabad. The seats were just pathetic, the kit in the back seat were not complete.. it just had a magazine there was no menu. The light over the seat wasn't working. A chewing gum stick at my seat. The cabin crew had their attitude.. very poor hospitality.
And finlly i ordar for a nonveg pasta hot meal. Pasta tasted as if they were prepared a week ago and the meal were no where near hot and so bland that we could not eat it after one spoonful. I will never order the food again on this airline. The advertisement of the food options made it look like they are going to be great but ""yuck"" is the word i can best use for the food served.

They have a standard answer that says, ""in coming flight is delayed"".  Poor attention to detail both inside the flight and in the counters.  Most flights are also small and the legroom is cramped.

Terrible Airline in terms of Customer service and Management.,Neel Patel,Ahmedabad - Dubai,"The Check In was smooth and then the lady on the desk pointed out to me a issue regarding my booked seats on my return flight from dubai. They were booked and as isle seat at the emergency exit and extra payment was charged for extra leg room seat. The seats which were booked were alloted online knowing that we had a child travelling with us which should not be allowed to be booked at emergency exit. We were changed to another seats because of the same. 

Secondly we had booked food online so that we can get the food on priority but the air hostess forgot to read our name on the list and were served upon asking that we had booked our food online. She did apologize but it was not a sincere one. The experience was as if she was doing some favor to us by serving us food that we had paid for in advance. 

Third on reaching Dubai when we received our luggage it was torn. We asked the attendant standing near the belt and he said that you can complain for the same online or at India.  This as usual everyone knows that later nobody would believe our complain as we had nothing else to prove that the baggage was torn by the spice jet ground crew. 

Fourth on taking our return flight we had booked priority seats which included food and priority luggage. But we were told that the food was not included even though it was mentioned in our tickets. I had personally confirmed twice from customer care about the inclusion or else i would have paid for it. On a lot of argument too they checked with the customer care and said that it would have been a mistake and we had to pay for the food in the flight. The food choice were also not available on flight as the food mentioned in the menue was exhausted. We had to do with what was available which in itself if very poor service and management. 

We did not even get priority luggage and it came as normal luggage with a priority tag on it much later that other baggage without the priority tag on it.

Attempts to rip off customers pretty blatant,Arul Victor S,Thoothukudi - Chennai (Madras),"A pleasant start goes a long way to a satisfactory journey and earning loyal customers. Some airlines just don't get the idea and Spicejet is among them. The fact that they covet your money is evident right from the start and shines far above their service. First stop is online check in. To be able to check in online, passengers must select a seat which costs a 100 rupees. No option of proceeding to check in with any seat allotted by the airlines. Then comes the experience at the real check in. The carryon baggage allowance is 7 kg which INCLUDES the laptop bag. It is hard to comply with this allowance. The airlines offers to charge for extra weight up to 12 kg to be carried on board. And that is in spite of not having any checked in luggage (I had a 15 kg allowance that I did not use). So, the point here is to rip off or inconvenience most of the passengers. Come to think of it, the airlines would be better off allowing passengers to take their bags on board as checking in a bag only increases the load on their labor in handling the bags thrice. But, they prefer to be pennywise and earning the wrath of the customers who are going to choose another airline in a route where there are multiple options for airlines (In the Thoothukudi-Chennai route, Spicejet is the only service provider and the people in the Thoothukudi counter think that they can impose whatever they want on the customer not realizing that the same passenger has the liberty to choose another airlines in other routes). Anyway, Thoothukudi airport is a horrible, little airport that lacks even basic amenities like bottled water beyond the security check area that the entire journey turns sour at the starting point. Given that Spicejet had a full flight and I paid top money for the ticket bought 5 days before the journey, I hope to see more competition and better passenger amenities in the future.",Domestic,2.0,August 2016,8 August 2016,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0

A hassle free journey at an affordable price,D_Agasty,Bagdogra - Kolkata (Calcutta),"On many occasions I have traveled in Spice jet , be it official or family tour, never faced any trouble. in this context I would like to mention another Airline named Indigo where me and my friend experience I am giving below which may help other travelers:

  "" Me and one of my close friend planned a vacation at Jammu and Kashmir in April 2014. After Darsan of MATA VAISHNODEVI my flight to Srinagar from Jammu was on 14th April(by GoAir). My son  came to Delhi from Kolkata on 14 April itself by taking a morning Indigo Flight,  joined by my friend  and his family at Delhi Airport and then they all supposed to fly to Srinagar by afternoon Indigo Flight on the same date. As I travel from Jammu so all of us will meet at Srinagar airport on 14th April afternoon and then proceed to pre-booked hotel. Accordingly I booked all the Air tickets, car and hotel using my debit and credit cards for both the families. My son reach safely at Delhi Airport. Now the worst part started. - I was utterly shocked when I got a call from my friend when I was at Jammu Airport that Indigo denied him the boarding by saying that his ticket was cancelled within 10minutes of booking by the person who booked it.  This is simply absurd. If it is so then why there was no communication from Indigo either by phone, message or mail about this and no refund also, Rather there was communication from indigo long after booking  that your tickets are confirmed. As they reach well in advance at Airport so next few hours they along with my son , who happened to be a doctor at Kolkata and my friend’s son in law who is also a doctor at AIR India DELHI, running from person to person of Indigo Airlines requesting so that something can be done. But most unfortunately nothing was done. We were very upset and because of this continuous conversation over telephone I was about to miss my flight from Jammu to Srinagar.   To save the tour, friend’s daughter some how managed tickets next day obviously at higher price - but was very furious and wrote a letter to Indigo Airlines which I am reproducing below.

""My father had booked an Indigo flight from Delhi to Srinagar on flight 6E555 for April 14, 2014 with booking reference number H3RFJS. He had booked this flight on January 21, 2014 at 2:49 pm following which he has a confirmation mail from indigo about his ticket being confirmed once at 2:49 pm and again at 3:42 pm on his e-mail id ajoychatterjee14@gmail.com. However, on reaching the airport on April 14, 2014, he was informed that his tickets were cancelled about which he was not informed earlier through mail or message by indigo. He was unable to board the flight and had to purchase tickets at higher costs for the next day and abandon his plans at Srinagar for that very day. The utter callousness of the airlines about the whole affair is appalling and the fact that he was not completely uninformed by the airlines about the cancellation is not a matter of joke. In the Airport the airline authority has informed him that his tickets were cancelled on the same day within 8 minutes of booking while he has received a confirmation mail 45 minutes later about his booking being confirmed of which there is a proof. Therefore, on this basis I would be forced to take legal action against these airlines for mental and physical harassment of my parents along with monetary loss. I therefore, request the airlines to look into the matter and inform at the earliest what steps they are taking, or else I would have to resort to a legal course.""

Poor Reputation in India.  Well deserved.,LK E,Hyderabad - Kochi (Cochin),"Staff both at the terminal and on the plane were very pleasant, but other than that, I can't think of a single compliment.  
*  At both airports, in fine weather, Spice Jet flights were the ONLY ones listed on the board as late for arrivals and departures.
*  There were fewer desk staff at the terminal than other regional airlines, so the line was long.  Still, the guy at the desk persisted in trying to upgrade passengers (for a fee paid there, which requires him to then leave the desk to get some form) which slowed down the line even further.  
*  We did get suckered into paying for the upgrade, which was supposed to give us early boarding, better seats, a free meal, and first luggage delivery upon arrival.  However, by the time the plane arrived, the crowd surged forward and there was no sequenced boarding, our luggage was close to dead last, the seats, though further forward, were in a plane with no differentiation of seats, and the meal was the smallest airplane meal I have ever seen.  Misleading all around.
*  In Kochi, gate labeling did not occur until late (since the plane was late) so at the time of original planned departure, there was no posted information.  (It is a small airport so every departing flight sits in the same large waiting area).  
*All of a sudden, once the plane did arrive, there was no audio announcement. So travelers had to scope out each gate for the whole delay, to ascertain where to go when it did arrive.

Can you imagine 5 to 6 hours in regular time.

I suggest people to avoid Spicejet and rather try Vistara or Indigo in place of Spicejet",Domestic,1.0,February 2016,3 August 2016,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Need to improve on attitude,AnkurGoyal2013,Kolkata (Calcutta) - New Delhi,"This was a good airline but it seems lately there is shift in their attitude ,rather than customer oriented they have started money orientation .Spice Max ,the new program they have started with priority boarding ,priority luggage ,food ,leg room they are charging rs 1000/- per ticket .If you see 3-4 min more at boarding and 3-5 minutes more at luggage belt is worth paying extra and above all the food is of no quality.They need to improve .If they want to charge more do charge but offer something substantial.",Domestic,2.0,July 2016,3 August 2016,3.0,2.0,N/A,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
Flight back to Delhi on a rainy day,Aman K,Bengaluru - New Delhi,"Have travelled in Spicejet some 2-3 times before but then that was 3-4 years back.Decided to travel once again and it was a good decision. Ferry from Terminal gate to plane in a shuttle to board.
Upon boarding asked for water and was served in a disposable cup.After all, this experience has been missing for some time now.
Anyways, took off from Bangalore and was smooth.Turbulent weather didnt allow seatbelts to go off for sometime even after  taking off. After reaching a good height (and plane was stable) signs were put to rest.Crew team onaboard started serving the pre-ordered food(they serve you cheaper if booked early) and then took rest  of the orders from fellow travellers,Normal transactions -10,20,50,100 Rs notes above 33 k Ft height :).
I like to have tea/coffee for sure onboard since can not sleep . Am not priviledged to dose off like my fellow travellers who fall asleep even before plance takes off.Anyhow, ordered pre-mixed tea and was indeed good, though costlier than on ground.
Seats are bit clamped in 787 airliner - guess this is 180 seater plane.But good enough for a small journey of upto 3 hours. I was pleasently surprised noticing leatherite seat covers -I have not seen these even in costliest airlines atleast in INDIA.Though these were clean and no litter in front or beneath it.

The services were par excellent. Better than other airlines - Red colored uniform of the crew adds to their vitality and vigour. Good choice of color !! 

Have seen a lot of office personnel also now going for this airline since these No-frills are becoming more conscious of time discipline.Families find this convenient due to low fares compared to other higher costing airlines.Remains a favourite with students and young working professionals who do frequent up and down to their home towns. 
Only missing thing is airway to directly take you to terminal entry upon deboarding the plane.Guess, this is their model.
Overall, a very good Indian airline for class and mass.",Domestic,4.0,July 2016,2 August 2016,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Plane was old,otherwise not too bad",Shourjendra D,Pune - Kolkata (Calcutta),"I was coming back from Pune ( PNQ ) via Bengaluru on flight SG 517. The departure time was at 1550. Flight arrived at Pune,more or less on time. Boarding got delayed as there was a last minute announcement by a stern faced lady from Spicejet,saying boarding would commence from 1st floor. So every person,both young and old had to climb stairs at the last minute,and then walk on endless corridors at Pune Airport, to board the plane through the only possible aerobridge at Pune airport.

Boarding done,but they closed the doors late. Trundled out of apron area,towards runway at a leasurely pace. Started to rain by that time. While plane was on main runway,it was raining cats and dogs. We thought possibly that was the reason for the delay. But finally we saw a ATR plane with its lights blazing coming down to land. Takeoff was fairly smooth,considering the fact that it was raining pretty heavy.

Flight went towards Bengaluru. We had to go all the way down from Pune to Bengaluru,as this flight to Kolkata from Pune was via Bengaluru,for some inexplicable reason. Anyway,weather was bad outside and we experience quite a turbulence during our one hour ten minutes flight. Then we realized that this particular plane was quite dated. It was a Boeing 737. Usually all the low cost airlines utilize the newer Airbus A-320 , or even the Neo in some cases. But SpiceJet chose to use this old aircraft. We reached Bengaluru eventually,and although it was a one hour stopover,again we got delayed as boarding at Bengaluru for newer passengers got delayed. There was a customary check-up of plane,and onward journey baggage's. After that one chap came inside and asked too see our boarding passes. Then boarding started with newer set of passengers,while we sat at our allotted seats.
Finally plane took off,slightly delayed,and once it was fully airborne,snacks and tea was served. Airhostesses , this time were a smiling lot,especially one called Shohini. She was both nice and caring. Came with glasses of water to drink. We didn't have any meal,as we were full. I bought a pair of chips ( Pringles ) and tea for me and my friend. Flight was more or less uneventful,although we reached Kolkata somewhat on time. I was amazed at better service and staff attitude,than what I had seen on earlier occasions.

Except the very old planes they are using,service and other things aboard Spicejet are not too bad actually

Worst Airline (SpiceJet),arpit p,Dubai - Ahmedabad,"Heights of the unprofessional attitude. This is reference to flight SG16 on 30/06/2016 from dubai to ahmedabad. When we reached to ahmedabad from dubai we didnt know what was coming. After waiting for our luggage at conveyer for about half an hour we were told by spicejet representative that spicejet missed around 150 bags at dubai airport itself. After digging more we came to know that this wasnt the first time. There were few bags which came for the customers who travelled before 2 or 3 days. Same thing happened with another flight also which came from Masqat to Ahmedabad. After considering the situation we demanded to speak with the duty manager there who didnt come at all. There was no one who can take the responsibility. Spicejet representatives were also taken aback by such a fiasco by their airline. The poor reason they gave was that because of Eid there was a very heavy rush and this happened. Because of heavy rush they already charged almost 1.5 to 2 times then regular fair and even after that they are giving service like this. Some of us has paid even for priority baggage even those bags were also missed. After 2 hours negotiations we were told that luggage will come within 1-2 days and will be delivered to you by courier. So i waited for one day and and called the number given by them. Now instead of one day they are telling it can take 2-3 days. 

I am travelling in international routes since last 2 years and this is the most poor service i receives by any airline operating internationally.

I was really upset with the behavior and smartness spicejet staff had shown to me. I had booked my ticket with my husband and we wanted two seats together. Just that the two tickets were booked separately and we requested if these two can be given seats together as my husband was unwell and I didnt want to leave him alone during the flight. However, the answer that I got during checkin was: no two seats are available together and if we need it, we have to pay 1000 bucks to upgrade to spicemax level. This is so pathetic guys!! We decided not to upgrade and request within the flight only. We still requested if we two can get seats in rows that are closer to each other. But look at the staff's smartness - she gave us one seat near the back door exit and one near the front door exit. So in this case, I cant even see how my husband is doing. And moreover, both the seats were middle seats - so cant be exchanged too!! Our fellow passengers on isle or window seat, would NEVER want to shift to a middle seat! How cheap one can get seriously!!

When we boarded the flight - for both routes - BLR to BOM and BOM to BLR - we spotted empty seats just one row ahead or behind. And when we inquired, those seats were not booked by anyone. 

We would never want to travel by Spicejet as this is not the first time but several times we have seen them fetching money and forcing us to suffer. This company is just running after money now!

And after checking in I found out that airlines had been delayed by 30 min which gradually became 50 min but they cheeky packed every one in the buses lest it become 1 hour as it was the late night flight and they have to arrange for food of the passengers if got delayed more than an hour so after waiting for nearly 15 minutes in buses we boarded the plane the seat i was sitting  6A its reclining was not working so i had to push the seat  manually to get some leg space ........ so from now on i am going to push spice jet away till they improve ........   i had much better experience with indigo and Go airlines.,Domestic,3.0,June 2016,27 June 2016,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Misbehaving Staff @ Airport Check-in Counter | Horrible in Flight Experience - HoneyMoon Trip almost spoiled,DRS,Mumbai - Srinagar,"I  am Dhaval Sarvaiya passenger of flight No SG 160 boarded from Mumbai to Delhi flight on 10th March,2016.
 
MUMBAI AIRPOT SPICE JET BAGGAGE CHECK-IN COUNTER  :-
We had checked in  spicejet flight No SG 160 at Mumbai Domestic Terminal 1B by 5:25 AM and the boarding was to begin by 05:35 AM for the flight to depart at 6:05 AM.
We are well in time and things would have worked well had the Spice Jet Staff Ms.Apinder at the Check-In Counter not messed up.
When we reached there she initiated the conversation with a Rude COUNTER CLOSED Comment.
We (Me& my wife) pleased her | requested her that we are already in time , please let us check-in and board , she replied rudely and then agreed for Baggage Check-In where again our Baggage turned out to be excess by around 5-6 Kgs she is like either pay Rs.7000 or empty the baggage.
My wife ran to her Mom who was standing Outside and emptied the Bag and came back. Meanwhile at the Counter I pleaded and requsted Ms.Apinder to kindly let us checkin and find a solution to the matter rather she again started with her Counter Closed Story.
I kept my calm until my wife returned and the Baggage were again weighed.
Now she claimed Rs.3000 and she threatened Counter closed either pay Rs.3000 or CANCEL YOUR TICKET FLY FROM ANOTHER FLIGHT AND PAY THE DIFFERENTIAL.
How can your staff use such a language be permitted at the Check-in counter, whilst I am deciding what to She suddenly starts Sir Counter Closed. Surprising I was wondering whether she was there to guide and cater us or to threaten and remove Money from us.
This hampered my temper and I had to raise my voice which led in introduction of one of her Senior Ms.Asmat or Ms. Kashir who profusely requested us to make payment and we did agree to make the payment.
And again , Ms.Apinder had her dialogue , even after Check-In and payment WE DO NOT GUARANTEE WHETHER THE BAGS SHALL REACH SRI NAGAR | DELHI
This was the most disgusting statement one can ever hear, It was only my helplessness that I wanted to Board the flight there and then and all was in her hand else I would have registered a Complaint there and then against her this language and would have seen to it that she is dismissed. She took an advantage of my helplessness.
Next moment after payment Ms.Asmat is like we have not paid , however they allowed us to board the plane.
SECURITY CHECK-IN
All in the rush and Bush and Security Check-In I forgot my Laptop at the Security Tray as the Spice Jet Person standing at the Security was announcing my wife’s name as if waiting alone for me. ( Though the Bus to the plane consisted almost half a dozen people)
ON-BOARD THE PLANE
At the plane we had a Max Seat and Complimentary Meal – but when we called for Jain Meal – they din have and they offered us some cashewnuts and real | Tropicana Mixed Fruit Juice which on the first Sip me and my wife saw each Other’s Face- it tasted disaster -  We both saw the Manufacturing date which showed 13-09-2015 and six months to expiry which means the Product was to EXPIRE IN 3 DAYS WHAT IS THE ON-BOARD CREW DOING??
 
DELHI AIRPORT
The Boarding female Ms.Sana | Ms.Monica just announced our name , when we approached them they are like we have not paid Rs.3000 at the Mumbai Baggage Check-In and to move further to Sri-Nagar We shall have to pay an Extra Rs.3000 to move our Baggage’s and reach them safely at Sri-Nagar.
NOBODY ON EARTH CAN BE MORE HELPLESS THEN THIS THIS WAS UTTER DISGUIST AFTER MAKING A PAYMENT OF RS.3000 AT MUMBAI WE WERE AGAIN CALLED FOR MAKING PAYMENT AT DELHI FAILING WHICH OUR LUGGAGE WILL NOT MOVE.
They said CCTV shows we have not made payment whereas we called Ms.Asmat (9619188072) she agreed taking the money but she was like she again handed over to my wife and that is clearly seen in CCTV, we called for the CCTV footage which was refused by the Delhi Team as well as Mumbai Team. They just wanted to THREATEN US AND REMOVE MONEY FROM US.
Again Ms.Monica, like Ms.Apinder used the same Language Luggage will not board until you make payment. This was horrible.
We requested and pleaded for the CCTV Footage but how will they show when they did not have one. IT was only FAKE to draw more money from me.
I was allowed to Board only after made payment again to Ms. Sana | Mr.Ankur and they wrote on the Back of the Slip about payment at Delhi.
Enough of Explanation, now I wish following action: -
1.     Show Cause Notice to Ms.Apinder | Ms.Monica as to how they could say things like you Miss your flight | Board another flight | Luggage will not board | No Guarantee that Luggage will reach Sri Nagar. -

2.    Compensation for the physical Hardship and trouble and Loss of Laptop which contained personalized |Confidential data. Rs.15000/-

3.    Compensation for Non-Compliance for a Jain Meal On-Board wherein I am eligible for ONE Rs.1000/-

4.    Compensation for providing Expired Products on Board which Could have resulted Health Hazards for me and My wife. Rs.1000/-

5.    Refund of the Excess Rs.3000 given at the Delhi Airport.

I claim a total of Rs.20000/- from SpiceJet for all the Mishap that it caused on 10th March 2016 or else I file a suit in the Court of Law for all the Damages to me and my wife
 
Please issue a cheque favouring Dhaval Sarvaiya and let us end it all.

PS : I am a Chartered Accountant by profession , I neither have time neither Money nor Interest in fighting a legal case.
I am a Gujrati Banya and I wish to live calm and peacefully.
The amount above is not a Monitory Compensation for all what we experienced and suffered that day , its just an indication to SpiceJet to improve the Staff Behavior and the hazards. Once you pay for it and realise the pinch of what and how your staff behaves and next time onwards all will be Good.

Terrible,AnilKumarPorwal,Bangkok - Chennai (Madras),"My Wife & I with our two children were booked on Spicejet SG96 from BKK to MAA on 4th June 2016 scheduled to depart at 3.50am from BKK.

Being one of the only few airlines who do not have Express Self Check In at the world class airport, we had no choice but to que up at the check in counters which were opened by the outsourced Turkish Airline Staff. The outsourced staff lacked courtesy and did not understand a pinch of what the travellers said. Horrible reception.

After a sluggish issue of boarding passes (even the boarding passes are not their own), which took 1 hour, we completed Immigration swiftly.

We reached the gate No. D8 allotted to Spicejet by 12.45pm expecting to take a power nap at the world class airport's waiting area at the boarding point. But alas, there was nobody from Spicejet who could come and open the access controlled waiting area. Almost 150 plus passengers, including children, feeding mothers and elderly people were made to wait at the entry point of the Gate D8 upto 3.50am.

(1.) Spicejet did not have the courtesy to announce the delay.
(2.) Spicejet did not have any staff at the airport to open the gate so that the passengers could rest and use wash rooms, drinking water fountains, etc.
(3.) Spicejet did not update the delay in the flight information system both online and at the airport.
(4.) Spicejet started the boarding at 3.55am and boarding ended at 4.20am instead of 3.50am (30 mins late)
(5.) The airhostesses on board were poorly trained and hence could not handle the hand baggage of passengers properly. Ultimately, the flight was delayed by another 15 minutes because they had to offload around 10 nos. of hand baggage and issue receipts to the passengers for the same.
(6.) The worst was yet to come. After landing at Chennai Airport and clearing immigration (which took 30 minutes), the baggage was still to arrive. The bags arrived after a 40 minute delay.

Never flying with spicejet!,235divyaj,New Delhi - Kolkata (Calcutta),"Six of us travelling together from Dehradun to Delhi to Kolkata on a family vacation. We booked spicejet flights(the worst decision ever made). Dehradun to Delhi flight was delayed by half an hour and was not even announced. Okay. We arrive in Delhi. During the check in, the lady sitting at counter B06 decided to separate the whole group. Each of us were given middle seats in various corners of the aircraft. The lady had the guts to talk spitefully  to my father and ask him to pay to get 6 six seats together. What's the point of booking tickets together and arriving for check in way ahead of time. Then we wait for another two hours delayed flight. The staff of spicejet is the most unprofessional and has given us horrible treatment all throughout without coordinating the information on flight delays. Indigo Airlines - you rock. I have new found respect and love for Indigo. The
Indigo operates more flights and handles more passengers than spicejet. Maybe spicejet should take a cue and start taking lessons from Indigo on operations and customer management. 
Today I have my family with me. So I know I am comparatively safer with them at 2am in the night when I arrive in Kolkata. What if I was alone and I had no one to receive me this late at night? People book a certain flight according to their convenience. Spicejet needs to reconsider it's strategy and do something about this because I have never met anyone with good experience with spicejet since a long long time. 
The system still showed 22:30 as ETD. While we actually left at 23:30 hours. We waited till the air hostess and stewardess manually counted the no of passengers on board. Spicejet managed to spoil out good night sleep with their awful loud music as well.

J Sandhu and lady first officer ,for what we consider as the most bumpy weather affected flight and long and long and long descent into Mangalore in thunder,lightning and rain ! 
As for us,we have been flying for over 22years now all over domestic and international routes.Last time we had experienced a nearly similar flight was from Las Vegas to Charlotte in stormy conditions but yesterday's was the most difficult one we were in a smaller aircraft.
The crisp announcement of the lady first officer ( could not get the name correctly ... ms Jaiswal ?) just before descent...""expect turbulence next two minutes all the way till we land..."" was an understatement . It was probably 15 minutes or more of approach and a treat to watch the Arabian Sea side approach and the relief when we saw the landing gears open .
Thank you Captain and First Officer and thank you Crew on board and entire Spice Jet Team.

Holiday turned into a horrid-day by SpiceJet,Prashant_Joshi,Goa - New Delhi,"Flight Number : SG 178 (later converted to SG 174)
Goa to New Delhi
Date : 6th April, 2016
Seat : 11D

We had gone family holidaying to Goa and UNFORTUNATELY, booked ourselves on a SpiceJet flight. People I know were livid and the reaction was - ""Why SpiceJet""? Are you mad ?
Well, I could not understand at that time, but later did. 

The flight was originally supposed to depart at 5.10 P.m. At some time later (though about one month in advance) the message was received that due to summer schedule (as if the airlines did not know that they will have one) my flight has been changed to SG 174 departing at 7.00 p.m. (1.50 hrs. later). 

On the day of the flight, till about 3 hours in advance, the airlines kept telling us the time as 7.00 p.m. and then suddenly changed it to 7.50. When we reached the airport the timing had changed to 8.30 and then 9.15.

It was interesting, as I and many others like me, had family with them and small kids. Interesting because we were not informed till the time we had cleared security. After much hullaboo, we were able to trace out an officer from spicejet who was not ready to come and speak to passengers.

Lot of trouble was taken by passengers and finally CISF people tracked the officer and informed and requested him to come and speak to us. Heated words were exchanged, however, no explanation was forthcoming. All which was told to us that due to operational reasons, the flight was delayed. It was not at all bothered to explain the 'operational reasons' to the passengers. 

After much cribbing the officer arranged water because passengers were threatening to take action. The airlines promised to arrange for snacks immediately and dinner, free of cost. However, the snacks turned out to be one frooti, one banana and one 5 rs. wafers packet. Dinner was moved from airport and was promised to be provided on plane.

Finally, the plane arrived at left the airport at about 10.00 p.m. ... about 5 hours delayed ..from its original schedule. After at least 4 or 5 rescheduling.

There were people who missed their connecting flights and trains. There were people who had to spend extra in delhi to stay back and get tickets done for next day. There were people who had to shell out extra money because of taxi charges going up at middle of night. There were people again, who were going to miss their meetings because they will reach so later. Kids were to miss their schools.

Further, when the passengers boarded the flight there was no dinner for them as promised by the official on ground. It was such arrogance and cheating at its best, that spicejet would win hands down. I remembered Shashi Tharoor and ""CATTLE CLASS"". Guess, Mr. Tharoor did not take it seriously but SPicejet did.

It was a pathetic flight and Spicejet turned out to be completely nonchalant about its functioning giving two hoots to passengers comfort or convenience. No one was bothered even to speak or inform the passengers.

The airlines should be held responsible for harassment they meted out to passengers and officials, including senior officials should be proceeded against in court for their fraudulent ways.

I asked spice jet staff about the cause of delay but they could only tell me this ""Boarding process will start shortly. we have arranged some snacks for you, You can have it, from the KFC counter"".
People were getting frustrated by each passing moment, and the SJ staff could only talk about the snacks they are providing and also they really didnt care about the passengers, they were all standing there in a group making jokes and laughing.
So it was finally 6:30 in the evening, and still there was no flight, passengers got angry and started shouting on the staff, suddenly one of the got ready to deliver the reason for delay.
So basically that guy through some technical terms related to flight and planes and told us that in this weather we cant fly, but luckily there was one Air Force Veteran, who was travelling with us, who told that guy, to stop fooling people,  he explained to him and other passengers that the reasons he is giving are just absurd.

Bad. Not the Airline for me!,Gregory D,Guwahati - New Delhi,"Having a connection to Dubai out of Delhi I depended on this airline to be true to its word but at the last possible moment they informed us that there would be a delay of slightly less than an hour (because then they would have to either refund or put us on another flight) and they used airspace closure over Delhi as excuse.  Yet Indigo leaving slightly before Spicejet's adjusted time had clear and direct access to Delhi airspace.  Methinks, the airspace closure story was invented to avert liability for their delay.    On the way to the airport, the telephone helpdesk was obstructionist and when we went to the kiosk at the airport the young lady called the official somewhere in an office and received authorisation for a full refund so I could buy a ticket on Indigo right next door.  Several times I heard her on the phone confirming the full refund (I was also insured) and I rechecked by asking, ""so it's a full refund?"" before I purchased the ticket next door.  After the ticket was purchased I returned to Spicejet kiosk to arrange for the full refund only to be told that they cannot refund me in full because the flight was delayed by less than an hour.  ( I checked with the authorities and the flight actually pushed back well after the hour which make their stated time a joke).  On trying to reason with them you were up against a brick wall.  I am still awaiting feedback from civil aviation in Delhi to ascertain if there was any closure of airspace by them, which I suspect may not have been the case.  Subsequently sharing my ordeal with others, no one had anything good to say about them.  Why do you want to buy so much bad exposure?  Don't they know a happy customer is your best publicity?  Even though I lost a lot of money having to buy a more expensive last minute ticket from Indigo, the loss to Spicejet would only have been the difference between the full refund and the percentage they paid out because of the insurance.  Its costing them far mor than that in bad publicity.  So silly.",Domestic,1.0,January 2016,21 April 2016,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Flight delayed by more then 3 hours for regular two days I have observed,Rajeshwar Yadav,New Delhi - Genoa,"Very bad state of affairs. This flight was meant to fly at 10:10 am and scheduled to arrive Goa by 12:45 but without any prior intimation, it was declared at the airport that flight is delayed due to technical issues and it departed around 12:30 pm on that day. 

I was on a business trip and our event was there and I was supposed to overall look at the finer points of preperation but everything went for a toss. That was a bright sunny morning and no chance of delayed due to fog but it seems it was a connecting flight which was running late. 

But very next day on Feb 1 my other group was also booked on the same flight and same story they also landed around 3:00 pm where else actually supposed to land at around 12:40 pm.

In a nutshell very dis satisfied over the quality of many of my fellow passengers who were pretty unruly on board. The cabin crew did their best to give a great customer service and I can only give an excellent rating to them.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! PASSENGERS KEPT WAITING ON THE AIRBRIGE FOR BOARDING FOR 1HOUR AT MIDNIGHT,Ajit Barreto,Mumbai - Goa,"SPICE JET A1684 SCHEDULED FOR DEP AT 23.00HRS ON 17TH APRIL 2016 .
When we arrive at the airport we were informed that the flight was delayed by 50 mins!! (no textmsg/call/email was received from them). After an hour they announce it had been further delayed by another 10 mins!! WHY WERE WE NOT INFORMED AT THE BEGINNING THAT IT WAS A ONE HOUR DELAY? BECAUSE OF THE COMPENSATION CONSEQUENCES?
That was not all, they asked us to board after one and a half hour...
When WAITING  to board we were all sent on the Airbridge, there we were made to wait for OVER 90 MINS by MS  ASMAT (SPICE JET DUTY MANAGER)  who thereafter  tells us that the flight would not take us  FROM MUMBAI TO GOA but would take us  FROM MUMBAI VIA NAGPUR TO GOA. 
and SHE SAID If we were not interested in going via Nagpur then we would be put on the next connecting flight at 11.00am the next day!!!  There was supposed to be another flight at 5.00am in the morning but guess they cancelled that too???.
Ms ASMAT was most uncooperative, saying she could not contact her seniors who were busy at a meeting in Delhi!!!  Imagine all the passengers standing on the airbridge at 1.00am... and these inhumane staff of Spice Jet supposedly holding meetings in Delhi at this unearthly hour... and we were given No reason whatsoever about the change in route by Duty MAnager Ms ASmat ..except one word ""emergency""

AS WE ALL REFUSED AND HAD TO SHOUT OUR PROTESTS  NOT TO AGREE TO GO TO NAGPUR AND MOST OF THE PASSENGERS WERE ALREADY ON THE AIRBRIDGE (which was sooo full AND DANGEROUS) THEY THEN TOOK US TO GOA WHERE WE ARRIVED AT 3.00AM.

This is happening time and time again with Spice Jet!! THEY CANCEL/ DELAY THEIR FLIGHTS TO GOA AND DO NOT INTIMATE BY SMS/EMAIL/phone calls about their change of schedule and always have the same excuse ""AN EMERGENCY HAS CROPPED UP!!""
The same problem took place over the GoodFriday and Easter weekend where they cancelled their flights and delayed flights for over 7 hours...again without intimating the passengers.

Okay but nothing special,wandering_home,Jaipur - Dubai,"I flew from Jaipur to Dubai with SpiceJet. I've heard about better experiences from those who've travelled the route (or a similar route) with a UAE or Qatar based airline. The flights were on time and were fine; food was okay on board, but nothing special (""Okay, but nothing special"", is how I'd sum up the whole flight). Check-in lines were very long and the wait was ridiculous as they also had to check the visas of all Indian passengers. SpiceJet didn't seem to have enough people working the check-in counters. Also they had trouble understanding that I would receive a visa on arrival in Dubai. Calling in advance to ask some questions of the airline also left me shaking my head at their customer service as they were not helpful.

3. 2.00 am they started boarding passengers in the buses with so slowly that we were sure this flight would not leave before 3.30. No information provided and no apology.

4. After we finally board the plane by 3.15 since ours was a first seat and conveniently all doors were kept open we had to endure Mosquitos biting us which was worse than railways also.

5. When we argued with the staff that why no information from your side regarding delay the crew member argues with us in a rude manners that we are waiting for few more passengers.

Then what about us who were on time and also this could have said in a sweet and calm manner when already tempers were flying due to delay

6. Finally the flight was flown at 4.00. For delay refreshments are served which is spicy cup o noodles. That's not refreshment and we are paying for our seats. Not all can eat packaged cup o noodles

At eleventh hour I have got a call and it was informed that flight was again rescheduled at 12:30.Not sure why all the decision has been made at very last minute and passengers have to face consequences.
 
Again on 27th night @Colombo internation Airport , I have requested the person at Spicejet boarding counter to put a fragile sticker in my luggage but when I took the luggage at Chennai, I saw the sticker has been removed and saw one of my valuable thighs got damaged and liquid got spread out from a medicine bottle.

Poor legroom, unclean seats, expensive, not to mention poor in taste in-flight meals (Jet airways gives it for free at the same cost).
Besides, our flight on  both our journeys were delayed by almost half an hour. Since it was a domestic airport, we cant really blame the airlines, the air traffic has simply increased too much.

And in the flight we came to know that the flight has not having any pilot and the pilot have to brought all along from Delhi to fly the flight.
When the passengers got angry the air hostess demanding for the explanation of such worse service the air hostess (namely Debosmita and Sohini Debpriya) started saying that they are lady and the passengers have no right to demand such type of explanation and began to threat the passengers that if you dont want to fly then you can leave the flight.

Just look at the arrival and departure board at any of India's airports.  Ground staff I have now found at Jaipur, Varanasi and Dharmshala are simply not willing to help passengers.  Oddly enough the other airlines assist where necessary.  When you check in your luggage they deliberately don't tell you the weight, then don't be surprised if they grab your hand luggage, weigh it and then demand additional money.

the Indian Ryan Air,HollisterRanchGirl,Mumbai - Varanasi,"After flying Air India I was sadly disappointed in this airline.

They sell you lots of add ons when purchasing, too, like ""bags out first"" and ""priority check-in"" as well as bags (we had to pay to get over 15kg, unlike Air India where it's included).  The staff were EXTREMELY rude, very unlike our other experiences at airlines in India.  No greetings or smiles whatsoever.  Lines were long and chaotic at the check-in desk.  My husband put his seat back because the man in front of him reclined and the man behind him told the flight attendant he wasn't comfortable so she very gruffly told him to put it up.  My husband unfortunately had to ask the man in front of him to do the same as the seats are TINY.

Before embarking on the journey airlines such as these are inclined to show customer service, as they do not want passengers to cancel as its a loss to the airline. But when one leg of the trip has been undertaken passengers cannot cancel as their at loss. 

Flying experience:
Very good as a matter of fact. Smooth take offs and good cruising experience, landings are rather harsh and bumpy, but that depends on pilots. 
In flight service is nothing great i must say. Someone should teach spice jet air hostess to smile, as its comes with a lot of effort that exhausts them.

So I planned to take a nap and wonder what, my reclining seats are not working, its all stuck it doesn't moved back, I called flight attendant and he told he can change my seat, but I don't wanted to leave my brother alone so I said that I will adjust here.

Next, when I checked the seat pockets I found the air sickness back was full of puke and was really disgusting ( worst quality cleaning, housekeeping).

There were only two(2) flight attendants and I complained them about my issues they apologized and assured that this won't happen again.

An Expensive Low Cost Affair,arunimam,Bengaluru - Mumbai,"Ummm, ok so i never liked travelling by SpiceJet and try avoid flying if possible. However, for my return journey to Bombay, I didn't have any other option than to book this.
I try not be prejudiced about things or people or places in life, however, certain things or places justify the prejudice time and again and SpiceJet is one of them. Here are the few reasons why I dn't like flying it;
1) I do understand that when you do the same thing day in and day out, it does tend to get weary, however, this is a service and hospitality industry and moreover the job is self chosen right, even if you want to murder somebody, you have to be polite. However, I have never felt hospitable with SpiceJet. I am never said ""Welcome on-board with a smile"" nor ""thank you"". Sigh, anyways...
2) Out of the 4 toilets, the nearest 2 toilets (the ones near the cockpit) is always busy. So if you have ur seat up-front, you will have to walk all the way back till the tail-end.
3) There was an announcement made about the luggage coming on conveyer belt no.7, however, there was no conveyer belt no.7.
4) The announcements very unclear and at times inaudible.

Anyways, the above have been my experiences with SpiceJet not only this time but earlier as well whenever I've flown. Maybe they find me ugly and not worth acknowledging :). You might have had good experiences with them.

Flight SG 3106, originally supposed to depart GOI at 16:50 and arrive MAA at 18:25 but my experienced happened to be as below...

1. Flight was reported to be late with ETD, revised to 17:35
2. There was further delay, departure was not at 17:35
3. More delay after boarding aircraft due to technical problem
4. Delay in landing after arriving the destination for want of ATC clearance

To add to all the above, one of the baggages (hand baggage, checked in before boarding due to size) was missing. I had to run around here and there asking for it keeping my family (spouse and a 3 yrs old child hungry and waiting, yes, even though, the flight was so late, passengers were not offered any food. my family and I just had some beverage that we purchased on board, that too, we couldn't get food & drinks of choice on board, even for purchase, they carry very limited stock and don't  seems to have any plan to load additional food even there is expected delay, which was the case here)

Our missing baggage travelled to BLR with the plane, while we were waiting. Thanks to the local manager Mahesh, who investigated and confirmed that the baggage in there in the plane and will come to chennai by the same plane later in the night and and a spicejet staff, Jayakrishna, who was on night shift and promised to take care of collecting it from the plane, we left the airport at around 11 p.m. while the scheduled time of arrival was 6.25 p.m.

however they do not take care of that luggage. I lost all my 4 bottles 

of vodka and wine from the beautiful Goa which all in all is 

priceless....again only an apology and Sir next time we will serve you 

 better.......

needs lot of improvement,g g,New Delhi - Dubai,"there was No in-flight entertainment, nothing at all, and its good only for economy travel    and its saving grace is that its on time departure & arrival. All in-flight snacks are extra, nothing included, how is it a cheap airline I don't get it. Our flight was for 3 hours only so thank god for that.",International,3.0,January 2016,1 February 2016,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
dont waste money on spice max,kiranmir,Chennai (Madras) - Mumbai,"we booked spice max and let me tell you there is nothing special. the promised aero bridge priority entrance wasn't there. they charged us 1200/-rs total (300/kg) for extra 4 kgs, when the in-flight brochure states 900 rs for up-to 5 kgs extra. the flight was delayed.
food is good, but most of it isn't available, unless you have booked previously online though they charge you 25 rs extra inflight, yet not available.
not looking forward for another journey with this airline anytime sooner.
prices are low though.",Domestic,3.0,January 2016,1 February 2016,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

Economical flights but service needs to be improved,Aniwill,Mangalore - Mumbai,"I flew to Mumbai in December via Spice Jet and had to face a lot of inconvenience due to flight timings. 

Had earlier booked an afternoon flight which had postponed due to winter schedule. However, on the day of travel it was preponed and I received an intimation just an hour before take off.

Worth for money.,Amitpat,Dubai - Pune,"This is good service from Dubai to Pune and return. Its value for money although not great.

Business Visit,MISTRY_12,Mumbai - New Delhi,The airline is staffed with young professionals groomed to customer relationship and manner. The food on board is deep for pocket and offsets the low cost airfare.,Domestic,3.0,January 2016,30 January 2016,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
What a turnaround!!,Trip_Diaries,Mumbai - Port Blair,"Travelled this Jan with family. What a turnaround - from what I experienced many years back and after the series of bad media. Good food, much more energetic staff, nice inflight mag. For a low frill category-you have options (for a price - which is fair deal)

1. The first 5 rows are seats with extra leg room and added meal. But you pay for each sector which I suggest should not be the case for same airline connecting flights only sectors.

2. Meal upload should be balanced. You don't get your choice - first come first serve if you have bought the max seats at the airport. Maybe some upfront discounts for such travelers.",Domestic,4.0,January 2016,29 January 2016,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Worst seating,Mehta S,New Delhi - Goa,"We flew last week from Delhi - Goa and back on SG and it was the worse flight experience we had. The seating is cramped and the aircraft seats are in a bad condition esp on the flight  back from Goa . 
Both sectors we had flight delays and the staff and crew were most unapologetic about the same . The baggage took hours to come .

international sector,Shyamantika S,New Delhi - Dubai,"we traveled to Dubai this month and had quite a comfortable flight. we did not face any delays and were well look after in the flight. Despite being a budget airline they had a good menu to offer for inflight services.
the only problem was at Dubai airport where the airline did not have its own staff and were relying on Danata. slight hiccup at the time of check in but overall a good trip.",International,4.0,January 2016,28 January 2016,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A
Spicejet,Shuchita_Shukla,New Delhi - Bengaluru,The flights were getting late quite often. And we faced this problem thrice. Once my mom's flight was delayed by 5-6 hours.

Horrible,Samvidh B,Bengaluru - Ahmedabad,"The flight was delayed by 4 hours, they kept telling 15 mins - 30 mins and did not bother to inform correct information. the staff was rude and big hassle for old age people.

Average but cheap airline,Aditya G,Mumbai - Bengaluru,"I flew Spicejet during the times when they were knee deep in financial troubles. Everyday, they would cancel/ reschedule flights in bulk. I was really scared but thankfully, my flight being on important routes, was not cancelled. Only, the time was changed by 50 minutes, which was okay for me.
The experience was like just another budget airline, crammed space, no free food (Honestly though, this is like asking for a lot). Took off on (rescheduled) time and landed on time, and that's all that mattered to me.
You might want to look at other options for a while, until they completely sort out all their troubles. Fly Jet/ Indigo, or even Air India on less important routes, even if they cost a bit more.",Domestic,3.0,February 2015,27 January 2016,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

After getting onboard found that my out side window was having cracks when I tried to report they ignored like they dont care at all. I was praying that hope this is not my last flight of life.

Could improve communication,mekhalagopal,Chennai (Madras) - Colombo,"There is only one negative point regarding this journey that I booked with SpiceJet. Given that I had booked a few months in advance, they changed the flight timings due to their new winter schedule.

I had to reshuffle last minute to book an earlier flight to Chennai, but the staff were very helpful and I got a full refund for the Mumbai Chennai leg.
