2,7th January 2025,Taha Sabuwala,“abysmal level of service”,Not Verified ,"  I am writing this review to express my utter disappointment with SpiceJet's abysmal level of service, which has left me frustrated and deeply dissatisfied. Incident Overview: Upon boarding the flight, I discovered that the check-in gates were closed 30 minutes before departure, leaving passengers scrambling to make it on time without clear instructions or assistance from the ground staff. To make matters worse, when I landed at my destination, my baggage did not arrive on the conveyor belt. Follow-Up Nightmare: I followed up multiple times with SpiceJet's management and customer service regarding the missing baggage. I was informed that my baggage would arrive on the next flight to Mumbai at 10 PM on January 6th. However, after waiting beyond 10 PM, the baggage still didn’t arrive. Upon contacting customer service yet again, the response I received was nothing short of shocking: ""We don’t really know much about it."" Eventually, I was informed that my baggage was declared lost, leaving me stranded without my belongings and without the airline's accountability. Unacceptable Service: This level of negligence is beyond disgraceful for an airline that claims to serve passengers professionally. It is unacceptable that: The baggage was not loaded onto the flight, reflecting the cabin crew's and ground staff's complete failure. The customer service team provided conflicting and unhelpful information, adding to the frustration. No compensation or proper resolution was offered for the lost baggage, leaving me to bear the financial and emotional burden. Call for Action: Stringent action must be taken against the flight management and cabin crew responsible for this mishandling. It is unacceptable for passengers to endure such incompetence and lack of accountability. This experience has severely eroded my trust in SpiceJet, and I will actively discourage others from using this airline unless significant improvements are made. Conclusion: SpiceJet's service was terrible, disgraceful, and indicative of a broader failure in customer care and operational efficiency. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and appropriate compensation for my ordeal. Passengers deserve much better than this appalling level of service. I shall be taking Strict action against the flight management for this disgraceful experience; I highly urge and request people to avoid travelling on these cheap low-cost airlines with such a pathetic level of customer service , instead, I would recommend either alternative airlines to travel.",NA,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Mumbai via Udaipur,January 2025,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
3,18th November 2024,Tanishka Soni,"""worst flight experience ever""",Not Verified ,"  The worst flight service experience ever! We had originally booked a direct evening flight from Ahmedabad to Pune and planned our 2-day hotel stay accordingly. However, the airline cancelled our flight and rescheduled it to an inconvenient 3 AM slot, wasting one entire day of our hotel booking. To make matters worse, instead of offering another direct flight, they gave us a frustrating itinerary with multiple connecting flights, which kept getting delayed at every step: Ahmedabad to Goa, originally scheduled for 5:55 AM, was delayed to 7:05 AM. Goa to Pune, originally scheduled for 1:55 PM, was delayed to 2:55 PM and then further to 4:20 PM. This meant we were stranded at the Goa airport for over 5-6 hours, completely disrupting our plans.

I've never faced this with any other airline. They waited for the flight checkin to close to start checking the bags. I was forced to pay the full amount, but they gave a discount for the passenger who came after me. The flying experience was not good, a bathroom door that kept making noise in the air - it was loose I guess. It's really surprising that spicejet is still operating. Coming to my return flight (at 8:45am), I was hoping it would be smooth. But again, just at the time of checking in my baggage (7:35am), I get message that the flight has been rescheduled to 12noon. Upon checking with the staff they said the flight was supposed to come from Ahmedabad to Chennai, before going to Hyderabad, but due to technical reasons got sent back mid way. Even the 12noon was just an estimate and it can get delayed further. There was no other airline having a flight earlier than that too. And obviously now with higher prices since it's last minute. But anyways I took this as a punishment for booking Spicejet.

47,26th February 2024,S Chatterjee,“they refused to take responsibility”,✅ Trip Verified ," SpiceJet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience. Traveling with my family, a total of six individuals, we embarked on a journey from Amritsar (ATQ), India to DXB (Dubai) on February 24, 2024. The scheduled departure time was 08:40 AM, with a connecting flight from Dubai to London Heathrow at 14:30 Hrs via Emirates. Our ticket was booked through the booking.com portal as a single ticket, rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection. However, our experience with SpiceJet quickly turned sour. Departing from ATQ, the flight was delayed by 55 minutes. Upon arrival in Dubai, we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation. Initially, we were given excuses regarding weather conditions, despite the clear and sunny day in Dubai, and optimal weather conditions for take-off. Eventually, a member of the ground staff revealed the truth - the delay was due to SpiceJet's scheduling issues and the busy nature of Dubai airport. This delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to London Heathrow. Expecting assistance from SpiceJet, we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution. However, to our dismay, they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions. Their staff was unhelpful and dismissive, leaving us stranded in Dubai with our children. Consequently, we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the UK. I feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airline's deceptive practices.

Come a week before the flight SpiceJet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in Delhi and 10 hour layover options. At such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund. We wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover. This was denied too. They held on to our money for 6 months before doing this. This is not where the ordeal ends. The first flight was delayed. Sat on the runway for over an hour before take off. We had to rush and change terminals. We were assured that our suitcases would reach Jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff. They did not. We were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in Jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day. We were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family. We asked them to reimburse this amount too. They did not. We asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu.

It's been a month, and I'm still waiting for a revert mail. This lack of responsiveness and accountability is unacceptable.

When we requested lounge access due to the prolonged delay, the airline offered a meal instead. There were murmurs among passengers about SpiceJet's limited staffing and flights, suggesting that they might be playing games with travelers.

82,1st October 2023,S Harshun,"""a decent functional experience""",✅ Trip Verified ,"  
I had taken this evening flight to Calcutta, during the web check-in, I had opted for the random seat selection for which there would be no charges applied as I was travelling solo, so before 12 hours of the departure, I had received the seat. Check-in was done at the old T1 terminal at BOM where baggage drop was done swiftly as there was no line and queues which was surprising. The boarding started on time however I noticed that when I was about to greet the crew there were 2 crew members who were not really greeting any of the passengers and seem surprised that I wished them good evening when they reciprocated. Ideally greeting the passengers is something that should be standard. Also I noticed that the load on this flight was on the lighter side as well however due to the ATC clearances the actual pushback and departure was delayed by over 1 hour but this was not on the airline. The pilots did a good job of keeping the passengers updated about the reasons for the delay. The flight itself was operated on one of those Boeing 737-800NG aircraft that was painted in the erstwhile JetConnect liveries. The pilots tried to make the time en route on the flight and was able to retrieve my luggage soon without waiting too long. While Spicejet has been going through a lot of difficulties in recent times, and that was also reflected in the manner in which the crew seemed disinterested in greeting the passengers, there are still small things that the airline can do which can still make a small difference to the passenger experience because otherwise for the fare that was paid this was a decent functional experience that was able to get me safely to my destination.",Boeing 737-800NG,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Kolkata,September 2023,3,2,NA,NA,4,NA,4,yes

But, sadly I had to encounter the worst experience with Spicejet, where I was denied boarding on a mere request of writing only 2 words on the excess baggage receipt - ""Laptop Bag"" after payment of the excess baggage charges for the laptop bag that I was carrying. Such conduct from Spicejet was very unprofessional and dissatisfactory. When a customer pays the ticket price, he owns the right to travel through the flight and taking away this right is illegal in all terms. I cannot understand if there is a policy of spicejet to charge amounts for a laptop bag, what made the team cancel my onboarding on the request of adding these 2 words - ""Laptop Bag"" on the excess baggage charge payment receipt. To my utmost surprise, when I raised this with Spicejet, they are saying that I have only refused to travel and they did not deny onboarding. This is completely false, as any sensible person can vouch for it - if I would have to refuse travel I would not have even paid the excess baggage charges in the first instance. This is a pure betrayal from spicejet. At least, they should have the guts to accept what they did.

My recent journey with SpiceJet from Calicut to Dubai was a complete disappointment. The check-in process was marred by unprofessional behavior from the staff. We encountered an unfortunate experience with the staff, who displayed aggression and utter disrespect towards passengers. Adding to the distress, the staff demanded an exorbitant additional charge for our luggage, including an unreasonable claim for my baby's stroller, which we had previously taken on the same route without any problems during our outbound flight. This inconsistency and unjustified charge left us deeply dissatisfied. Despite providing proof of double payment, SpiceJet is yet to refund the excessive amount they charged us under duress. It is disheartening to see an airline of this stature failing to provide basic customer satisfaction. I sincerely hope Spice Jet takes immediate action and thoroughly trains their staff to treat passengers with respect and empathy.

The check in and baggage drop was smooth. The boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route. Noted that I was flying on a 737 Max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated. Also the plane was much quieter. However when boarding, most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual. Also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket, the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary. The safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin. It felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through. Perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment. It is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named SpiceScreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge. It had a decent selection of movies / podcasts / magazines which was much appreciated. The flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately.

Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious.

How can an airline be so ignorant to the travellers since we are the reason you guys have business. My cancelled flight was almost full, and they could have simply scheduled another flight for the next day. But they are now giving us indirect flights at the charge of direct flights which is generally higher. The staff was lying to the crowd that the direct flights are cancelled and giving us indirect flights. And at the same time, they were taking a few passengers to the side and booking them on direct flights.

It's via Pune and now the halt has been increased from 30min to 6hrs. There is no use of utilising flight as it's wasting my whole day with a halt of 6hrs. Now while cancelling this return ticket of around Rs 4.2K, te refund amount calculated is just Rs 572. So it's like I had money and I have wasted this with SpiceJet.

Also to note was how they kept the washroom sanitized after every five passengers had accessed it. I personally had a very bad headache that day and they helped me overcome that by providing excellent service. They were very polite (although I know it is their job). The steward was very kind to first ask me if I had taken food before getting me a pill and lukewarm water (this matters because medicines have to be taken after food and with lukewarm water and not every flight steward/stewardess bothers to make sure if the passenger has eaten something and if the temperature of the water is right). After this, the stewardess approached me a second time to enquire if I was doing okay and if I needed something which I thought was a very sweet and generous gesture from their side and I was so satisfied and happy because I had never received that kind of treatment on any flight before. I know it is the job of an air host/hostess to attend to the passengers, but to date, on every flight I've been to, none of them have come back to enquire about my health after attending to me once.

I had pre booked the non veg and veg lunch meal for my family members which consisted of a chicken and egg biriyani as the non veg option and veg biriyani as the veg option. The food also had a bun and a cup of yoghurt and even though the meal was not bad, the quantities seemed to be on the lesser side. Landing was in time however I noticed that as the passengers were de-boarding, the crew did not thank the passengers and they had their backs turned instead of thanking the passengers and this was maybe the only negative in what was by and large a very good flight. The pre booked meal on Spicejet seemed to be of more quantity compared to other rival low cost carriers operating in India but still if one has to purchase in flight, it can get expensive as it starts from 250 INR onwards. Even though LCCs are in the habit of maximizing revenue as much as possible, one can be smart about this and perhaps have food before the flight.

Now, I understand why they have this policy, and that's not the problem I had with SpiceJet, as I realize that part is my fault. The problem was how SpiceJet customer service handled it. No information, hanging up on me every time I called to check the status of my bag, needing me to send the appropriate paperwork multiple times before removing the powerbank and sending me my bag (which took over 48 hours). I don't understand why it's so difficult to simply remove the powerbank (which I gave permission to do) and send the bag. Yet for some reason, the people who work for this airline are completely incompetent. Not only that, but I received a message on WhatsApp that my bag was arriving on a certain flight, so I drove 1.5 hours to pick it up. But when I arrived, the bag was not on the flight! Instead, it was on the next flight which landed 3 hours later. Since we were about to leave Kochi and go to Alleppey, I had to wait for it. I spoke with the people working at the SpiceJet counter in Kochi airport, who didn't seem to care at all and kept saying ""well maybe it will come tomorrow"". I made it clear I wasn't leaving without the bag, and told them I'd wait for the next flight. I left to get some food, and when I returned, no one was there -- the counter was closed. Fortunately I was able to get the terminal manager to help me get my bag, but if they weren't going to be there, why the hell didn't they just say so when I told them I'd be returning? Truly a horrendous experience with SpiceJet customer service, both in person and on the phone -- completely unhelpful in every way possible. The second time we flew SpiceJet was no better, as we were charged double the price of our ticket to change our flight by one day (even though online it says you only have to pay the difference of the fares, which is a lie). On top of that, there were over $100 of hidden fees added to the ticket price, which we were not informed about until it was time to pay. We were told we either had to pay it, or we'd lose our current flight AND the new reservation.

SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Bengaluru. This was a very good flight where everything went very smoothly from check in using the kiosk machines to the baggage drop, everything was flawless. The boarding started before the scheduled time which was a plus point and the flight was very full. One slight disadvantage is the need to pre pay the seat while doing online check in. However, if one arrives at the airport early enough one can select their seat preference without needing to pay the additional cost. But then this is a practice most LCCs do. The plane itself was used formerly by Jet Airways, so the seat pitch was on the more generous side which was well appreciated for a trip that was lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes long. We took off before departure time, the crew were proactive and personable enough with the fellow passengers when it came to the food / drinks. The pilots also announced and kept us updated regarding the flight path. Arrival was also well before the scheduled time and collecting the baggage was done quickly without the need to wait for long.

This needs to change. Airlines exist for customers, customers don't exist for airlines. (2) On a previous reservation that was cancelled by SpiceJet and refunded in full, the full refund was issued as a new transaction rather than reversal of the previous charge.

Moreover when we reached the check-in counter they refused to accept that we had our PNR nums marked and said that they couldn’t help us at all. Later, the senior executive came and spoke to us. Honestly, she couldn’t help us with the situation at all and later when we told her about the call center person who told us she’d arrange help, the senior executive asked for her name and asked us to call her back and if we couldn’t do that we could book another flight. She had a lot of attitude and just showed that she was least bothered in helping us. They have stupid officials at their call center who just know what to say or what to do. I’d strictly recommend anyone reading this to never use Spicejet as they have horrible services. This is just one of the most disastrous experiences I’ve ever had with any of the airlines. Later on, we had to book another flight to get back so yes we chose indigo which is a way better flight than spicejet. We had to book our tickets at the airport itself and since the ticket counter was very crowded the indigo official took us to book our tickets, took our baggage and made it very hassle free for us.",NA,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Chennai,September 2019,1,1,NA,NA,1,NA,2,no

Even though SpiceJet caused the issue, they refused to have our baggage delivered and they refused to compensate for costs to go to and from the airport (which is quite high in Dubai). When I got back to the airport to pick up my baggage at 3, they delayed further and we waited until 4.30-5 to get our luggage. The SpiceJet manager at Dubai airport refused to speak to us and was literally hiding in the SpiceJet office.

397,7th August 2019,Ujjval Jain,"""our whole trip was ruined""",✅ Trip Verified ,"  I had booked four tickets from Spice Jet to fly from Pune to Cochin.  It was a pre-planned holiday and two out of four were on their honeymoon. We had everything booked and scheduled - the cab, itinerary, hotel bookings and everything was paid in advance. Spice Jet being such a reputed and big airline spoiled the whole holiday with their unprofessional ignorant attitude.  We reached the Pune airport at 10 a.m. on 29 July as our flight was scheduled to fly at 11:25 a.m. and we issued the boarding pass on the kiosk and the same was sent to us on WhatsApp by Spice Jet team. We proceeded for the security check. Upon reaching there the security officer asked us to report at the check-in counter, at the counter we were shocked to know that the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours and later got cancelled due to some technical issues. Spice Jet officials straight away denied that they cannot do anything about it and we have to see something else on our own. After a lot of heated argument they agreed on shifting us to the immediate next flight from the Pune airport but we were given wrong information about the available flights too. There was a Go Air flight at around 1 p.m. which we agreed on taking to and later on they refused us to accommodate in that flight. We did not know what to do as we had a schedule to follow right after our landing in Cochin.  When we requested them for some other options, we were told there was a flight at 4 - 4:30 p.m. Indigo flight which is a direct flight to Cochin. We agreed as there were no other seats available in any other flight. But when I checked it online, it was via Bangalore that was taking about six hours to reach Cochin. Had I not checked it, they would have shifted us there with this misinformation. This is such an unprofessional behavior. If the flight is cancelled last minute then ethically they should support their customer who is suffering because of the last minute cancellation rather than giving up on them and providing them with wrong information. Then I checked the online flights available and saw Go Air had an available flight from Mumbai at 5:20 p.m. which was landing at 7:35 p.m. which was still suitable as we had time to reach the hotel at least. Spice Jet team first did not agree to this then after requesting to SpiceJet senior team member that our entire money will go waste, earlier he refused but after pursuing him a lot he booked us in the Go Air flight from Mumbai. The Spice Jet person after booking it told us that your bookings are done and we’ll offload you from the airport and you go and get a taxi on your own at around 11:45 a.m. Pune to Mumbai taxi fares are high, we were not prepared for it and also we were not liable to paid it too. When I requested they out rightly refused, after a lot of argument they agreed for the taxi. We took our flight from Mumbai and landed at Cochin at 7:30 p.m. Our whole day was spoiled because of the last minute flight cancellation. We are middle class people, we plan the holidays in advance and take a fixed budget.

On the day prior to the departure I received a text message that the flight had been ""preponed"" by a hour because of runaway repairs at Dhaka. Appreciated this update. At the airport, SpiceJet's international counter opened about 90 minutes prior to the flight's departure. A man checked passports to determine if visa to Bangladesh was in order. He sat at a counter that said ""Air India"" - this confused some of us. The twin engine propeller plane was parked out on the tarmac and a bus ferried the passengers to it. The short flight was smooth though loud. Flight attendants were efficient. My vegetarian sandwich was dry; I needed to pay extra to get a water.

538,31st January 2018,D Thane,"""recommend you avoid this company""",✅ Trip Verified ,"  We were booked to fly several SpiceJet flights in November 2017. One of these flights was a flight from Delhi to Goa. Shortly over a week before we were due to fly, SpiceJet notified us that the flight was cancelled due to a runway closure. Frustrating of course, but apparently out of their control, so we were initially understanding. What was in SpiceJet’s control however was the customer service experience that followed. To summarise what has been a truly horrendous experience spanning 3 months. SpiceJet could offer no alternative flight that day, so I we had to book an alternative flight at 3 x the price. Due to the cancelled flight being the 2nd leg of a connecting flight SpiceJet calculated the refund of the cancelled leg on an unfair ‘km by km basis’ rather than the price paid for each leg, leaving us out of pocket due to the 2nd leg being much more expensive. SpiceJet erroneously refunded only 1 passenger of the 2 on the cancelled leg, leaving us an additional 7000 INR out of pocket. After querying this we were told the refunded amount was correct and that this was the end of the matter. It took 7 phone calls spanning 3-4 hours, over a period of 5 weeks to receive the refund for the 2nd passenger. Each of these phone calls was to a different agent and involved explaining the situation from the beginning each time and battling the front line denials and scripted replies in order to actually discuss the issue. We were assured on each of these phone calls that the refund had already been processed (it hadn’t) or that it would be processed (it wasn’t). Only after threatening a credit card chargeback and refusing to end a call to a manager before the refund was manually actioned was the owed money refunded to us, more than a month later. From the UK we spent over £50 on phone calls to India to get our own money refunded. In total due to a combination of administrative failures on SpiceJet’s behalf, we are out of pocket approximately 22,000 INR (£250 GBP). After escalating a formal complaint to the top of their complaint channels we received no apology or acknowledgement of failure and were offered a 2,000 INR SpiceJet travel voucher which we refused. All in all, this has single-handedly been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered with any company, anywhere in the world. SpiceJet may get you from A to B, but if you have to engage with their customer service departments via phone or email for any issues, prepare for a time consuming, fruitless and ultimately incredibly stressful experience. For your own sanity, I highly recommend you avoid this company at all costs.",NA,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jaisalmer to Goa via Delhi,November 2017,1,1,1,NA,1,NA,1,no

No one announced us what was going on, even though we asked several questions and insisted that most of the passengers have other flight connections to catch in Delhi. At some point, a stewardess told us that the people from the stairs insisted that the plane has to wait for another two people to join the flight. No clarification was brought to us. It is still unclear if Spicejet sold more tickets than the available ones in the plain, or the group of Indian people making the scandal considered is their right to stop the plane until two more friends will join, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that the crew did nothing, but waited for 1,5 hours after the boarding was finished. The passengers asked them to call the police or the airport security but nothing happened for 1,5 hours. It was a huge chaos. At some point, many passengers, tourist mainly step out of the plane, arguing with the group of people who wanted to stop the plane for departing. No reaction again from the Spicejet crew.

SpiceJet, as you may know is a low budget airline, but who knew in this case that low budget means lowest quality? My family and I started our return flight back to Dubai with discomfort, for our seats were positioned directly in front of the emergency exit doors. So whilst we couldn't recline our seats, those in front of us could. Let me just say this resulted in little to no room for sitting, reading, or even for that matter sleeping. To provide a more visual description we were literally trapped in our seats, so if you get claustrophobic either pray you get a better seat or better yet I would recommend avoiding the flight itself. This dissatisfaction didn't stop there. The food which my sister and I had specifically pre ordered due to our dietary constraints (paleo) and already paid for was not available. As we couldn't eat any of the other meals available, we had to order 2-3 other meals and scrape at whatever we would be able to eat, which wasn't a lot as the portion sizes were extremely small, in comparison to the food available at the airport which we didn't consume due to the fact that our pre-ordered meals would be served on the plane. This review is specifically targeting SpiceJet's management and organization, not its cabin crew who were in fact very helpful with providing additional meal alternatives for us. It's a shame to think that these issues could have easily been avoided if my family and I had been informed of our seating locations prior to boarding.

We decided to go for only left options Bhel & Cappa Noodle, so when she came to serve us the same then she asked for 350 Rs./-, I offered US Dollars because I found that in menu that they had 2 prices mentioned against each item, one in rupees and another in USD and I did have US Dollars with me (Because my current residential status is US, so my preferred way to spend money was US Dollars). She replied “let me check whether we have change for this or not” I said Ok. She came back after long and mentioned we don’t accept US Dollars in Indian flights, US dollars mentioned in menu is for our (Spicejet) international section only. The point here is when this is the rule then why she did not make it clear when I offered US Dollars in the beginning, why did she tell me that “let me check whether we have change or not”. I offered Credit Card, she said Machine is not working. Then finally I offered my last preferred mode of payment “Cash in INR” and then she accepted that and returned me the change. The staff who was dealing with me was very rude not only to me but I found her same behavior to others as well. The point here is that I would not be complaining here if things were dealt with smile and hospitality. Mistakes can be ignored if there is a humbleness and soft skills.

They said I have no other options. When I asked for hotel/Lounge service as there is a total delay of nearly 12 hours to reach Chandigarh. They simply denied and said no such facilities are provided. They just provided 1 basic lunch.  I had to spend more than 6 Hours in the Bangalore Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility and nearly 7 Hours in the New Delhi Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility.

The Spicemax product offers seats with more legspace at the two front rows, priority check-in baggage arrival and complementary beverage and snacks. I feel the only reason you can buy the product is if you want priority arrival of your checked in baggage. Keeping in mind the price you pay for the product, the legspace, food and beverage quality was quite ordinary. You would rather want to be in the economy seat and buy meals and drinks on board or from elsewhere. It's much cheaper that way. The legspace, contrary to their claims, didn't seem all that wide. I am a short man but felt a taller passenger would struggle there. The airhostesses were polite and answered my enquiry about beverage choice available. Didn't interact with them much but from whatever I felt, it was fine. The captain or first officer kept quiet throughout and didn't provide any update on weather, arrival or location.

At security check there was line cutting from other people which was very frustrating, but it isn't airline's fault. To start with, value for money was absolutely 5 stars. The check-in staff looked like he worked 24/7 for 50 years; he was not kind, and I felt he wasn't willing to help. For ground service itself, I went to the plane by bus since jetways can't be connected to Q400, so beware. For seat comfort, it was very narrow. Seat pitch was average for LCC but felt shorter than IndiGo's A320. I was able to rest and the seat was comfortable to sleep. For cabin service, it was not bad but not great. Cabin crew were well trained and took care of passenger safety and told passengers to remain seated after the landing. Other than that, everything was average. For food and beverages, they provided water for free and the average cost of items is about 300 rupees. Overall, I do recommend this airline despite its little bit ""rude"" ground staffs.

594,16th February 2016,Liam Gillespie,"""service was excellent""",NA,"Had a great experience with Spicejet from Kochi to Mumbai in the air but a pretty poor one on the ground with this airline. At check-in the Spicejet employee asked to see the credit card I booked the tickets with. I explained that between booking my tickets and travelling, my card had expired and I had been given a new one by my bank. Hardly a rare occurrence, I would assume. I had to explain this to him three times but he still asked the same question. He eventually called his supervisor who also asked me the same question, forcing me to explain again. She then called another supervisor who checked my passport and let us check in. This caused quite a delay and unnecessary annoyance. However, when we boarded and departed (on time) the service was excellent - friendly and welcoming cabin staff, clean and comfortable cabin with decent leg room (I'm 6'1"" and it was more than ok for a few hours) and good value/tasty food.

595,9th February 2016,Sukhjeet Kaur,"""manners not appreciated""",NA,"On 3rd February I took a flight from Mumbai to Kashmir from Indigo. Service at the counter was efficient and prompt. I exceeded my check-in weight limit but the counter staff acknowledged that I had no handcarry and allowed me to check in the excess weight as well, and this left a very positive impression of IndiGo. On 6th February I took a flight from Kashmir to Amritsar using SpiceJet. No complains although nothing was memorable. Most likely because my baggage was underweight and I had no Handcarry. On 9th February I had another flight with SpiceJet from Amritsar to Delhi. This time my baggage exceeded the weight limit. I had no handcarry but the staff was adament I remove items from the baggage and handcarry them. It is a simple request which can be adhered if communicated well. I was in queue for almost half an hour and shoved left and right between counters. I maintained my cool because I understand the staff was busy. Once again the counter staff told me to continue waiting as passengers from earlier flights will need to check in first.  Does that mean the counter staff will rudely tell you off to remove the excess weight immediately or pay the additional fees. I am expected to wait for ages for the counter to serve me but when I am need to remove the items from my baggage, I have to let all other people to finish checking-in? Another group of passengers were complaining and they got served immediately. So should I assume that manners are not appreciated by SpiceJet? As a result the staff does not have respect for the passengers? My flight to Delhi was scheduled at 4.10pm. My boarding pass said 2.55pm. When I asked the staff about the timing, they don't know what time will the flight depart. They told me to wait and listen to the announcement.

We didn't pay close attention to the ticket we received, until we arrived at Colombo Airport 3 hours before the flight. We then learned that our ticket was for February 15.  We also learned that they had empty seats. We explained to the manager that we had to leave Sri Lanka because our visa was just about finished. He offered no help, and wouldn't even call the main office to get us a seat on the plane. So we were forced to buy a new ticket on SriLanka Airlines at the airport, and fly out that way. As I write this, I have emailed SpiceJet three times to get our money back. And understand that our tickets are still good for another week. So far, the only response I get from their customer support, is that I need to write someone else, but they don't tell me who that is.

However, the cabin crew was the opposite as they looked tired and although they tried to be friendly, they weren't welcoming. The vegetarian subs they had on board was pathetic and considering the cheap quality, the price charged for the subs was quite high. The cabin experience is standard as you really can't expect much from a regional aircraft like the Q400 but I really feel that Colombo being an international sector with high demand, SpiceJet needs to use a Boeing 737.

Since I didnt have much of Rupees i decided to pay in Dirhams. I offered 100 AED for an item of 15AED. They said they didnt have change so I had to skip dinner.

There was no airline staff to guide stranded passengers. We came to know that 25 bags were offloaded. After filing the lost baggage complaint, there was no way to reach SpiceJet office to arrange delivery in Abu Dhabi the next day. Finally reached them in their India toll free number.

605,2nd July 2015,Arti Gupta,SpiceJet customer review,NA,"My experience on SpiceJet was the worst I have ever had. It started off right from Dubai airport at check-in. My flight was meant to depart at 23:10hrs. The display said 23:10 when we entered the queue and within minutes the display for Delhi departure turned to 02:20hrs. A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given. So my son and I left the queue and sat down in the waiting area. After about 45 minutes we asked another member of staff and we were told the check-in had re-opened - no announcement had been made though. After check-in I contemplated returning home and coming back 2.5 hours later - when I asked how I can get accurate flight status I was told it is best to hang around at the airport. Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said ""sorry madam, it is finished. This flight was diverted to Mumbai and the aircraft was not serviced in Dubai so we have run out of supplies"". I returned to my seat and tried to get some sleep. The rest of the flight was uneventful but devoid of service of any kind. There was no drinks and snacks, even though it is meant to be a paid service. Not even water was offered to the passengers - only those who asked got it. At one point I woke up and went to the galley to ask for water and the air hostesses were asleep! Unacceptable standards of service. Agreed SpiceJet is a budget airline but even so there is something called professionalism which was totally lacking here.

As it's a low cost airline there was no inflight entertainment. We had opted for pre-booked meal options but we've got SMS that food will not be served. When enquired with the cabin crew they didn't have any concrete answers. Anyway flight landed on time. Kochi-DEL. Flight was scheduled to leave at 7pm from Kochi but delayed by 1.5-2 hrs. It was scheduled to stop at Mumbai but changed to Hyderabad. At Hyderabad no one was sure whether we continue in the same flight or change planes. After 10-20 mins we learnt that we needed to get on another plane. Again we got the message that meals are not available in the flight and even no water bottle given to us in all the flights. I am not sure why they still have the meal option on their website.

They did not have most of the things printed on the menu. On the return leg the flight was on time to CCU from Port Blair. However there was a delay in CCU due to some mechanical failure. Had to wait it out at the airport. SpiceJet has an on time guarantee service. A few days later we received a complimentary RS.500 coupon to avail on spice jet flights.

Flight on a new 737 but legroom was tight but the seats were ok for a short 3 hour flight. Service was extremely inefficient it felt like the cabin crew did not go through proper training. It took them more than 2 hours to service the entire aircraft and we were lucky enough that we pre-ordered our meals beforehand. Also they served our meals first before our drinks which should have been the other way around. We nearly choked waiting for our beverage. Food however was of excellent quality. The quality and quantity were great and while it was just a basic meal the taste far exceeds that of other major airlines like Emirates. Overall a mediocre flight.

614,5th May 2014,Patil Durvankur,SpiceJet customer review,NA,I travelled by Spicejet flight (SG-248/247) from Mumbai to Goa and back. Both times the flight was delayed by 15-30 minutes from the scheduled departure. The biggest let down about Spicejet is the fact that they have a very extensive food menu but they don't have any food or beverages onboard (except for water). I had pre-booked and paid for a meal (Chicken Sandwich) for my onward flight which was never served to me. The reason given to me was that there was no food available onboard. Don't get fooled by the pre-booking discount (20%) they offer as they charge a convenience fee which eventually escalates the price more than buying the same meal on flight. The FA's just keep running from one end of the fuselage to the other carrying papers in their hand. I can't recommend Spicejet.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,4,2,N/A,NA,NA,3,no
615,3rd April 2014,P Vish,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Travelled from PNQ-BLR return. Both flight were airbus A320. Punctual and left on time and reached few minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin crew were friendly and cheerful. As it was just an hour long flight I did not opt for any in-flight food but I observed that the portions were rather small. Seat pitch is bit cramped but OK for short domestic flights. As expected from a budget carrier there was no in flight entertainment but the in flight magazine was nice. Total 22 kilogram baggage allowance (15 for check in and 7 for cabin) is also generous. Overall pleasant experience will definitely fly with them again.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,4,4,1,NA,NA,5,yes

I have written some really good reviews in the past about Spicejet however this experience was not up to my satisfaction. The aircraft used was an old Boeing and the interiors were extremely shabby. Most of the seats were torn from all corners and were in extremely poor condition. The leg room was the worst I have experienced on a flight. They need to sort out the basics rather than focusing on being #1 in terms of on time performance.

Of those 5 three were cancelled without any issues with weather/external circumstance (i.e. all internal SpiceJet operational issues) and one was delayed by 2 hours. Only one flight managed to make it to the destination on time. Worse SpiceJet does not pay for hotels or offer any sort of recompense when they cancel a flight due to operational issues (including not having enough passengers) all they offer is to book you on the next available SpiceJet fight (note that they refuse to buy you a ticket on any other airline) which is usually the next day and forces you to either pay for an additional hotel night out of pocket or lose a night that you had already paid for. They don't even offer to make the seat selection free after forcing you to change your plans completely. The additional 250 rupee charge is just a slap in the face after they tell you there is nothing they can do about completely disrupting your travel a day before you are supposed to leave. They are the worst Indian airline. Not only does SpiceJet not get you to your destination on time you're usually a day late.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,no

All 4 flights were delayed from 30 minutes to more than one hour. This made reaching connecting flight very difficult and I almost missed a flight back home to Europe because of that. I pre-ordered food on all this flight and got the same meal every time. Once the meal was delivered just a few minutes before the preparing for landing instructions came.

Kudos to cockpit crew for a smooth take-off climb cruise descent and landing in somewhat perilous conditions (heavy rains). Plenty of legroom and well-spaced-out seats on board with ample reading in the in-flight magazine. Disappointing that the airline does not stock a few extra hot meals for those who didn't pre-order them.

We took off from Mumbai relatively on time and reached Goa in 45 minutes contrary time given by airline which was 1h 05m. I found the seat comfortable with enough legroom.

631,25th March 2013,S Menon,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Round trip from Chennai to Hyderabad. Morning departure from Chennai. The boarding was complete 20 minutes before scheduled departure time and then we had to wait for close to 30 mins for a piece of cargo to arrive from another location. The captain was prompt enough to explain the reason for the delay hence there was no confusion. Clean aircraft with attentive cabin crew. Return flight at night was delayed 2 hours but was informed about the same in the afternoon through a text message which I think is a positive step. The flight to Chennai was operated by an all women crew which I think is a first as far as the low cost airlines in India are concerned. Overall good experience.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,4,4,N/A,NA,NA,4,yes
632,13th March 2013,Manika Verma,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Very bad customer service. Flight delayed 30 mins initially then 1 hour 2 hours 3 hours and it went on and on. The cancellation was not allowed by the customer service because apparently their systems were not update with the reality on the airport. Stranded at Chennai airport for 8 hours and tried to change it but was disregarded by the staff. Being economical does not mean that you start ignoring passengers who are asking you legible valid questions as and when you feel like.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,2,3,N/A,NA,NA,1,no
633,18th February 2013,Debaditya Haldar,SpiceJet customer review,NA,BOM-CCU-BOM. The flights were on-time each way. Cabin crew were warm and friendly. Have travelled Spicejet earlier as well and was impressed to see the improvements they have made over the years. The only issue I had was on my BOM-CCU flight where the leg space was inadequate. However the flight from CCU-BOM was excellent.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,4,4,N/A,NA,NA,4,yes
634,24th January 2013,S Shetty,SpiceJet customer review,NA,21-01-2013 BOM-COK Boeing 737. The check-in procedure was quite disorganised with the longest possible line for any airline I could see at Bombay. Their website says you cannot do web check-in if you need to check in baggage. For an early morning flight this rule makes you leave home at least half an hour before other airlines. Staff allotted me an aisle seat in the non-reclining row before exit without informing me since I am relatively tall the leg space was quite insufficient the only reason to be thankful was the gentleman in front of me did not recline his seat. Overall have had better experiences on other Indian budget airlines like Indigo. Staff are good but could do with some more training. Would I fly this airline again - perhaps but the price will need to be good to consider this alternative.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,2,3,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,3,no
635,20th December 2012,R Marsh,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Mumbai to Goa and back. Good airline which was on time. Food to buy on board. Free checked luggage allowance.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,4,4,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,5,yes
636,20th December 2012,Nirmal Sasilatha,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Colombo (CMB) to Chennai (MAA). Aircraft used was Bombardier Q400 with a flying time of around 1 hrs 40 mins. The aircraft was clean and new. Check-in and boarding was smooth and efficient. Very comfortable flight. Overall a good experience.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,5,3,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,5,yes
637,13th December 2012,Rishad Patell,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Goa to Hyderabad on a Bombardier. Nice aircraft. Flight was delayed but we were informed a few days prior. Overall good experience.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,5,4,3,N/A,NA,NA,3,yes
638,22nd November 2012,B Dsouza,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Less than 24 hours after I booked my ticket online I got a text message letting me know that the flight time had changed by 30 minutes. On the way to the airport I got another text message letting me know that my flight would be delayed by 30 minutes. I got to the airport and was told the delay would now be an hour. One hour later after the original departure time the plane didn't show up for another 30 minutes. The plane was small but clean and looked new. Bottled water was handed to everybody. Overall the flight was pleasant but the delays make the trip exhausting for I spent more than 4 hours at the airport. Also while it was nice they sent a text message it would have been nice if they sent an email. I'm not an Indian resident but got a local phone and realized I wouldn't have known about the flight changes if I didn't have a local phone.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,3,3,N/A,NA,NA,3,yes
639,23rd October 2012,V Agarwal,SpiceJet customer review,NA,MAA-TRV. Chennai Airport looks like it needs replacing and the security queue snaked around the terminal building. The flight was late boarding mainly because the domestic terminal only had two gates in use. Aircraft was a modern Bombardier Q400 which was two thirds empty. The wrong aircraft safety card was in my seat pocket I showed this to one of the crew and she replaced it. Cabin Crew were attentive and efficient in their tasks. Flight arrived 30 minutes late into Trivandrum and the bags took about 15 minutes to come out.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,3,4,N/A,N/A,NA,NA,4,yes
640,30th September 2012,Rishad Patell,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Flew Bombay to Kochi on Spicejet. Early morning departure and a full plane. My partner and I got seats in the last row - uncomfortable and cramped for the 2 hour flight but a full flight so no chance of changing seats. Poor service on board with terrible crew. Got to Kochi only to be told the return flight was cancelled on our date of return. Called their Customer service and were rebooked very efficiently on another flight- and even to a new destination as we had missed a connection. Flight back much better. Service great. Was like flying 2 different airlines.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
641,11th September 2012,J Padma,SpiceJet customer review,NA,We were flying to Trivandrum from Chennai. The journey takes about one hour fifteen minutes. The flight was announced and we boarded at 6.30 pm and were supposed to take off at 7 pm. No announcement till 7.15 pm. When passengers approached the cabin crew they did not know what was happening. The flight crew was arguing with the ground staff. There was nothing to eat or drink. The pilot announced that there will be some refreshments but nothing came. Finally after an hour and half the flight took off. We reached Trivandrum around 9.30 pm. The experience was awful. If there was an issue the airlines should have delayed the flight instead of boarding passengers and make them wait on the Tarmac without any option of cancelling the journey or even getting refreshments. We never did the mistake of taking a Spicejet flight again.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no
642,27th June 2012,S Srivastava,SpiceJet customer review,NA,This is a low fare airlines that appeals to many budget minded travelers. However the airlines baggage policy is completely out of line with the international standards. For example most international carriers offers checked-in luggage up to 23 Kg while SpiceJet is only 20 Kg. The carry-in is limited to 7 Kg only. When you check in your luggage after arriving from overseas journey SpiceJet charges 200 Rupees per Kg an extraordinarily high rate. Checking-in Staff are eager to charge and seldom give a consideration to a traveler's appeal. One feels trapped as there is no option. My advice to SpiceJet increase the weight limit to 23 Kg and institute a flat fee in Indian Rupees equivalent to $25 dollars for an extra piece of checked-in luggage not the 200 Rupees per Kg rate. My advice to international travelers do not expect any concession from ground staff; most of them are trigger-happy to charge fees for extra weight.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,yes
643,17th February 2012,V Bagaria,SpiceJet customer review,NA,On time departure from BLR and 30 mins early into Kolkata. Relatively old aircraft but well maintained. Quality of food served was good.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
644,10th September 2011,Mohit R Singal,SpiceJet customer review,NA,DEL-KTM-DEL on a relatively old B737-800. Nothing much is expected from a LCC but the worst part was the leg room and space. As we were travelling with our 6 month old child we barely moved for the entire 1.5 hrs flight due to limited space. Barring this everything else went fine. FA were courteous and helpful.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
645,3rd August 2011,Lakshya Sharma,SpiceJet customer review,NA,BLR-DEL. Smooth check in friendly ground crew. We were flying their 737-900 aircraft. Poor seat pitch. I'm 5'11 and my knees kept knocking the seat in front. Agreed Economy airlines offer bad legroom but this was hopeless. Luckily I was the only person in my row and could get some extra room by reclining the middle seat. Food is not free as with most budget carriers rates are good.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no
646,22nd July 2011,Siddhant Verma,SpiceJet customer review,NA,SpiceJet from Hyderabad-Delhi. My sister had booked a ticket for me using an international credit card but when she realised the ticket should be booked using Indian credit card if the ticket owner is not travelling she managed to get an Indian credit card from her friend and called customer care of SpiceJet and made the payment using the Indian credit card. When I reached check-in I was told I can't board the flight because payment had been made using a credit card of someone else. They didn't listen to me we had checked 4-5 times with the airline when making the payment that this would be okay. I was harassed by the staff and they asked me to pay the money in cash. Finally they took cash and asked me to sign a declaration and only then could I board the flight. When I reached home and called their customer care they just said sorry it's our system's fault.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no
647,28th February 2011,Rishad Patell,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Pune to Delhi return. The outbound was delayed and so my 11am departure became a 3pm departure. They kept messaging us the delayed time but does not help when you have appointments you are missing. The ground staff in Pune had no empathy and we got not even a hint of an apology for the delay. Cabin crew nicer - friendly attitude and good service. Return delayed as well by one hour. Check in staff in Delhi no better. The only reason I would not recommend this airline is that every flight on both days seemed to be running late.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,no
648,22nd February 2011,Torsten Roehner,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Jaipur to Kochi via Mumbai. Clean aircraft friendly crew a bottle of water free small offering of food an drinks to a fair price. I was surprised of the product quality. The new domestic terminal in Mumbai is clean and has quiet corners to relax.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
649,11th February 2011,H Suda,SpiceJet customer review,NA,BLR-DEL-BLR because their price was very attractive. The meal price is reasonable and meal was good. Seats okay service fine. The return flight was delayed for an hour however the crew was apologetic.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
650,11th February 2011,G McArdle,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Delhi-Kolkata return on 737-800. The check-in at Delhi was fast and staff polite and helpful. The departure was on time and plane was spotless. Seats were allocated there were no charges for checked luggage and a bottle of water was given to each passenger. In row 11 the seat pitch was fairly tight but only a problem when the person in front reclined her seat. Check- in at Kolkata was OK but travellers should be aware that you go to have all your luggage scanned before going to the check-in desks.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
651,24th July 2010,Anish Patil,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Cochin to Mumbai. I As it is a low-fare airline you have to buy food or drinks onboard but prices seem reasonable. The plane seemed clean. It was an uneventful flight quite different from the glamor flying with Kingfisher. But for the money we spent it was a worth the value.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
652,2nd June 2010,G Warren,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Delhi to Chennai. 3 hour delay due to dodgy plane. New plane had 18 fewer seats but we still try and fit everyone on. 3 adults and 2 kids per row. Don't start the air conditioner for an hour as you sit on the tarmac in 45 degree heat. Almost mutiny everyone standing up and waving their arms around. No food and the least leg room I've ever seen on a flight.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,no
653,15th March 2010,Rishad Patell,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Pune to Delhi return flight. Convenient timings with a 9am arrival in Delhi. Smooth check in and service on flight satisfactory. Return again convenient with a late evening flight arriving at 2300. Full flights both ways so aircraft crowded and the leg room in the seats are so limited that you feel crammed in for the flight. Fare similar to others but as its non stop it pips Indigo airlines on this route.,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,yes
654,2nd February 2010,J Patel,SpiceJet customer review,NA,We booked our tickets on Spicejet with a travel agent in Surat on August 2009 for travel January 2010 for Goa to Mumbai flight in the afternoon so some of us can catch a flight back to US from Mumbai that night. As we were standing in line at Goa airport for more than an hour they took down the Mumbai sign at the check in counter. On inquiry the check in person told us the flight was cancelled and the fare will be refunded to the travel agent- no other assistance or help. We had to scramble to GoAir counter to get to Mumbai before we are no show at the international flight. GoAir charged us INR 45951 for 7 tickets to Mumbai. Spicejet is irresponsible in its policies and attitude. They left 200+ international passengers in limbo at a place without accomodation or any other help. In light of our experience I would advise anyone with any plans for further travel to stay away from booking their tickets on Spicejet unless they want to jeopardize their plans and wallet!,NA,NA,Economy Class,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,yes
655,28th December 2009,T Schroeder,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Keenly priced tickets. They take a practical view of baggage allowances which is very helpful. Overhead lockers are somewhat low and can be awkward for odd-shaped carry-on bags. FAs are very courteous. Seat pitch is unsatisfactory but for short flights this may not pose a problem.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
656,23rd November 2009,Kurt Müller,SpiceJet customer review,NA,CJB - DEL (via HYD). Departure punctual arrival late due to endless approach into Delhi. Whilst you get what you pay for in terms of service on this type of airline I was surprised at the rudeness of the CC. When on the ground in HYD one of them addressed me as if I was an inmate in a prison camp for wishing to use the toilet. However in the air with turbulence warning and seat belt signs on pax were walking up and down to the toilet freely.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
657,17th May 2009,G Abrol,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Mumbai-Delhi check-in did not take very long. Seats were pre-assigned as the flight was full 20 mins delay departing. B737-800 cabin clean. Seat pitch very tight. Food for purchase was a good selection of snacks and beverage ie. sandwiches cookies muffins tea coffeeetc. Cabin crew disappeared after food sale and only returned to collect the trash. Overall a good experience except for the very tight seat the price was extremely competitive.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
658,7th November 2008,A Sanghvi,SpiceJet customer review,NA,BOM-DEL and IXB-KOL. Both flights were heavily delayed. Was the worst Indian airline in terms of punctuality and service. Also they seem to get the furthest possible bays which means taking almost an hour from the plane to the airport after landing. I would not fly with them again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
659,29th July 2008,David Leston,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu. The time of my web-booked flight had changed but I had not been notified of this and therefore arrived at the airport far too early. Luckily there was an earlier flight and the person at the ticket counter changed my booking to this flight at no extra cost. Seats were allocated at check in but there was no scramble anyway as there were only 100 passengers. The 737-800 was clean and the crew were quite friendly. Overall a positive experience - but Spicejet have already started cutting routes and frequencies so things are looking tough for the Indian locos.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
660,23rd May 2008,A Mudgal,SpiceJet customer review,NA,Pune to Chennai return. Flown for the first time with them and found them okay. Planes were new and clean. Both flights were on time. FAs well groomed and do a good job. Food served was not free and was more of a snack. For the fare they charge you its a very good airline to fly with in India.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
661,30th March 2008,Kurt Mueller,SpiceJet customer review,NA,DEL-CJB (via HYD). We chose this flight for its convenient timing. SpiceJet's ticket office at Delhi Airport is very hard to find (as an exception to the rule it's located outside the temporary ticketing hall). Check-in friendly and efficient. Boarding via a bus with a ridiculously high step. Flight left on time meaning we actually lifted off the runway at the scheduled time of 1710 (a miracle given today's crowded Indian airports). Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages. These two unpleasant situations were not handled well by what came across as a particularly arrogant FA. Landed in CJB on time.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
662,23rd December 2007,S Srinivasan,SpiceJet customer review,NA,PNQ-HYD. I booked with a foreign credit card which caused a bit of a delay at check-in. All boarding at Pune is done via remote stands though it was done quite efficiently and we actually pushed back 5 minutes early. The plane was a B737-800 and it was clean and well-maintained. The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase. The flight arrived at HYD about 5 minutes early and although my bag was the last on the carousel it only took about 10 minutes to appear. Overall a good value for the price I paid at about $52 for an advance purchase one-way ticket.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
663,4th October 2007,Brijesh Singha,SpiceJet customer review,NA,AMD-HYD return quite happy with the product. New B737-800. Were offered soft drinks & peanuts on a 1 hr 15 min. flight. FAs attentive and efficient. On-time performance both ways. Can't really fault the offering. I'd rate it as above average LCC experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
664,16th May 2007,Teemu Hentunen,SpiceJet customer review,NA,DEL-BOM-DEL. A good and cheap budget carrier. New spotless aircraft friendly service and flights were in time. I have no complaints at all except the horrible Delhi airport but that is not the fault of Spicejet. Everything about Spicejet reminded me of Easyjet if compared to an European low-cost airline.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no
